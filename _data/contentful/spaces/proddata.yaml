  title: 'Are you done yet?: It’s the only question that really matters'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I recently wrote a letter to a young man in county jail I had never met. I asked a simple question: “Are you done yet?”

    I asked it repeatedly, because really, for someone sitting inside, it’s the only question that really matters. His mom had reached out to us at Criminal U and asked us to write him. We did so gladly. He was in jail. He had avoided doing serious prison time. He was already preparing for his return to life very soon. He hadn’t had much time to truly get sober, get serious and get real.

    Yet, I loved his answer.

    “I’m so done,” he wrote me.

    I have no choice but to take him at his word. I know well, especially for addicts like this young man, that even the best of intentions often fall short. Even those who seemingly do everything right while inside head back out and trip up, relapse, re-offend, and return to the revolving door of prison life. For those under the age of 23 even the best of intentions face terribly long odds: 84 in a 100 will return to prison.

    That’s why we write to people in prison. That’s why we try to help with their network when they get out. That’s why we created Inside Innovations as a means to tapping that criminal energy and turn it to pro-social success.

    And that’s why I ask over and over again. “Are you done yet?”

    The problem we have to confront if we are going to change those terrible odds of leaving prison behind is we have to change our approach. We have to find out who is truly done and pump energy into these candidates. We also have to start figuring out long before they get out.

    We have a legitimate way to do that. Those who know the best are the very people we aren’t asking. Ask other inmates about a guy on their block, or a guy they work with in the kitchen, or even better a cellie. Ask them if the guy they know is done.

    They know. They get it right far more often than they get it wrong.

    The [Norwegian prison system](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people) figured this out. Their guards function with the inmates in normal ways, all in an effort to humanize them, prepare them for re-entry with an important side-effect of getting to truly know them. I suspect those guards know who is really done.

    In America the guards know very little. The inmates, well, they know.

    Here is just one example: At the end of my sentence for the final 18 months I worked as a tutor with about a dozen others helping guys earn their GEDs. The job was considered one of the better ones. You had to apply and had to have some references from others who worked their. The education department needed the right people who could both help, but also deflate the criminal code energy that keeps guys from reaching their potential.

    One of the guys I helped get a job there came to me and said he knew someone named Brian he thought would be a good tutor. I vouched for Brian, even though I didn’t know him.

    Two weeks later my friend came to me and apologized. He had vouched for the wrong guy. We all knew it. Brian was no where near done. He said all the right things, he talked a good game, he was a smart guy. But Brian hadn’t learned a thing about his crimes and his behavior and was a sure bet to re-offend once he was released. We all could see it. But because he talked a good game and was “cool” with the guards, he kept getting promoted into better work crews with better jobs.

    I was the least surprised when that friend emailed me recently with a news article about Brian. He had been out just a few months and was already back in jail: “Accused scam artist busted for allegedly ripping off handicapped and financially distressed people,” the newspaper reported.

    > Brian Page, 47 of Newport, has been arrested by Newport Police following reports that Page would seek out mentally handicapped or financially distressed people on the internet, give them a bad check and then keep their money. Police say Page would “carefully choose people to cash checks for him that were forged.” In return for cashing the checks “Page would promise the person or business owner that their debts would be partially or fully paid.” Police say most of these fraudulent transactions were going on in Newport and in the Otter Rock area. They also say that Page may have contacted a great many more victims than what they’ve found out about. Police are asking anyone or any business that may have been a victim to call Newport Police at 541-265-4849. Page is being held in the Lincoln County Jail in lieu of a third of a million dollars.

    via [Accused scam artist busted for allegedly ripping off handicapped and financially distressed people](http://www.newslincolncounty.com/archives/59758).

    He wasn’t done. We all knew it.

    The system as it exists now has few ways to tapping into the knowledge that comes from other inmates. As a result, finding those who are done and will benefit from the newly discovered interest in prison re-entry will never be as effective in targeting limited resources to those who will most benefit.

    The only solution: Start early. Go inside the prisons and get to know the people in there. They will reveal themselves. Inside Innovations tries to not only change the culture inside a prison, but use the time spent in prison in finding and training people who are done, and thus ready to make a meaningful change. Too much of the current effort is focused on when a guy leaves prison. The result will be far too many failures. We need to start the re-entry effort earlier. We need to tap the knowledge of those who know.

    Are you done yet? I ask every time. Guys don’t always know. Many intend to be done. But more often than not, inmates can figure it out.

    For those truly done there is no guarantee of success. But those who aren’t, like my old pal Brian, there is nothing that can be done for them.

    Figuring out the difference is the missing link to truly lowering those terrible recidivism rates and the significant challenge for those seeking innovative solutions in the years to come.

  title: Virginia seeks to curb imbalance of blacks in prison pipeline
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The goal of a new initiative in Virginia is to help solve the problem of racial disparity in Charlottesville’s juvenile justice system following a study that showed that arrests of young back men is disproportionately high compared to whites in the state.

    The Black Male Alliance launched a new initiative Friday by reaching out to young men of color to get involved in helping to change these statistics and break this prison pipeline.

    According to *The Daily Progress*, the city’s Disproportionate Minority Contact task force report said that blacks were being arrested three times as often as whites. Many of the arrests were results of calls to dispatchers. Stops initiated by the police tended to be more racially balanced, the results showed.

    “The main conclusion of this report is that Black youth are entering the system in disproportionate numbers compared to their White counterparts,” the 108-page study revealed.

    The initiative, titled Black Male Achievement, will introduce two programs to the area in an attempt to give young black men guidance and access to the resources they need to be successful.

    The Young Lions program will target a younger age group of high school students, while the My Brother’s Keeper program will target young adults from 18 to 25.

    “We believe through policy and systems change we’ll be able to remedy some of these inequities and improve the outcomes for Black males,” said Marc Philpart, an initiative leader and associate director of PolicyLink.

    According to assistant city manager and city liaison for the Black Male Alliance, David Ellis, it will be impossible for the initiative to be successful if they don’t garner the necessary support from the community.

    “This will have to be a community effort – not one department, not one nonprofit, not one faith-based organization – to be able to do what needs to be done, so we’re all going to have to come together,” Ellis said.

    Specific information regarding the programs’ plans has not been released.

    The programs will explore a variety of different career and educational goals in order to make the right plan for success for each young man.

    “Success is relative for everyone,” said Wes Bellamy, a member of the steering committee for the Black Male Alliance. “For one male it may be just going to get HVAC certification, for another male it may be getting a degree from a college, for another it may be getting a doctoral degree. Success is relative, and we’re going to allow the young men to define what success is for them.”

    The effort should be applauded. Increasingly we are seeing that those hit the hardest in the era of mass incarceration need the most innovative solutions. True reform must come at all points in the prison pipeline: 1) Innovative pre-trial diversion that breaks the school-to-prison pipeline and keeps young men of color out of Criminal U in the first place, 2) innovative training programs inside Criminal U and 3) aggressive re-entry programs to reconnect those returning to productivity pipelines within society.

    This effort by the Black Male Alliance should continue to help, especially on the back end of this problem.

    Other innovative solutions, like the one [Inside Innovations](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/inside-innovations-turning-inmates-into-entrepreneurs#home) is offering, will further bolster young male achievement.

    You can do make a tremendous contribution today in just five minutes:

    1) Spend two minutes watching [this video](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/inside-innovations-turning-inmates-into-entrepreneurs#home) about the problem and the solution.

    2) Spend one minute donating at least five bucks as a vote of support.

    3) Spend two minutes emailing, tweeting, liking, sharing this campaign to your network encouraging them to get involved.

    Join the movement of true change that will empower those who need it most, those most cut off from the productivity pipelines essential to be a thriving member of the community.

  title: Aramark puts food on the tray for pocket change
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "In an on-air conversation with host Phil Allen on 900am
    WURD in Philadelphia, the topic turned to prison. He immediately jumped to the
    food they serve, promising to post to twitter a sample of the food.\n\nI had to
    laugh, because this food wasn’t news to me. I ate far too much of it in my time
    at Criminal U, and as Allen said, “I wouldn’t feed this to my dog.”\n\nQuality
    or not, a million meals a day is a pretty good business model, and that is exactly
    what Aramark Correctional Services, a division of Aramark accomplishes.\n\n“ACS
    prepares well over 1,000,000 meals a day for state and municipal facilities, partnering
    with our clients to meet the unique challenges of the corrections environment,”
    the company website states.\n\nMost people know Aramark the global food services
    company. Likely not as well-known, but nonetheless illustrative of the power of
    prison economies, is its corrections services division. Aramark actually provides
    more than just groceries to prisons and jails. Aramark provides prepared meals
    to more than 600 jails and release centers.\n\nThis service grew during The Great
    Recession crunch on state governments. Desperate for ways to cut budgets, Aramark
    filled the gap. It is saying something that Aramark provides cheaper meals — cooking
    them and delivering them — than jails themselves could make using free inmate
    labor.\n\nStill the company has its fingers in a lot of pots specializing in a
    type of service that few could hope to compete with. \n\nMost importantly, governments
    are increasingly looking to outsource prison-related expenses. The run-up that
    tripled the number of incarcerated people over the past twenty years was highly
    profitable for many reasons, not the least prison construction. But operations
    are another costly matter and the true costs of “tough-on-crime” legislation are
    now coming due. Governments routinely turn to privatization when this occurs.
    Here Aramark is well-positioned to grow its market share rather than retract.\n\nAramark
    is virtually immune to public criticism it seems because they get their share
    of it– far more than they serve on an average meal like this: Prison reform groups
    frequently take shots at the quality of Aramark food being served to those inmates.
    Typically the company is only required to provide a set amount of calories each
    day. So huge helpings of margarine are added to the calorie count. Or subsidized
    corn products like corn cakes routinely take the place of more expensive flour
    pancakes. These “efficiencies” are not well received by those eating them. As
    could be expected, lawsuits have already been filed.\n\nI suspect none of this
    was unexpected or news to ACS brain-trust, who like many large companies factor
    in the legal costs and public backlash when taking on new, potentially controversial
    accounts.\n\nWith food like this being served — again its cheaper than food made
    free by inmates — it’s easy to see what prison spreads like the recipes I wrote
    about in my ebook, Prisons Spreads 101: prison food, culture and recipes, are
    so incredibly popular among inmates.\n\nSo here’s where the argument takes a turn
    for the weird. Talk about the crappy food being served inmates and a good swath
    of what we call “normies,” — those who are not addicts and criminal and end up
    in places that serve Aramak’s food — say simply, “Good.”\n\nInmates should eat
    crappy food, many believe. It’s a point I don’t really argue much, other than
    to say, inmates should not eat food that will sooner or later kill them, as this
    food is proven to do. But let’s leave that debate for another day.\n\nBecause
    Aramak’s lovely food isn’t going to just inmates. How do you feel about your grandmother
    eating this food in a nursing home? Or your child eating it at school?\n\nThis
    is the point of Prison Spreads 101. Nothing removes the barriers of barbed wires
    and bars like food. We share a food culture regardless, and that food culture,
    especially as typified by a company that serves a million meals for less than
    .50 each a day, is created by the likes of Aramark with nothing but a profit margin
    in mind.\n\n\nThe corrections slice is not the whole pie. Government contracts
    for schools, corporate contracts, sports concession food and a host of others
    comprise those 1 million meals.\n\nLike it or not, you AND someone you know eat
    the same food. You support the profits that keep it coming, one disgusting meal
    at a time."

  title: Malcolm X showed transforming power of Criminal U
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    May 19th is the birth date of arguably one of the civil rights movements most controversial and impactful leaders: Malcolm X.  He remains a widely misunderstood figure who too often is viewed only as one who stood in stark contrast to the peaceful provocative ways of Martin Luther King Jr.

    Militant minority groups have long sung his mantra of “by any means necessary,” which became a slogan too often for more hate and racism and intolerance among those first persecuted by such a thing.  Few could argue that his lasting impact on political and institutional reform comes anywhere close to the collective efforts of MLK, SNCC, SLCC the NAACP and other centrist organizations.

    But such characterizations only cloud the importance of Malcolm X. He and MLK were not ends on a spectrum but more like two armies on different battlefields using different tactics.  Both were essential and both remain important symbols of progress for those marginalized in society.

    Back when I was in graduate school, I sought a professor to help me with a doctoral thesis in history that would explore the three theological strands that form the collective rope of powerful civil rights change: Christianity, Islam, and African tribal religions. The idea captivated me, yet as one professor told me straight forward, “Blacks have grown weary with whites telling them their history.”

    I couldn’t argue the point so I opted not to pursue the degree. But my interest in civil rights remained. My studies continued. Malcolm X remained a focus of interest largely because as a highly flawed person myself I could connect with his growth that never stopped throughout his life. He was constantly in the process of transformation, which eventually led him to leave the Nation of Islam and eventually cost him his life. He refused to stop growing. In many ways his personal morality and strength of character came to surpass the more widely praised King (no disrespect to King who deserves the memorial on Washington’s Mall, a place of national honor).

    Like so many we write about here at Criminal U, and many of those who have joined our efforts, a significant part of our personal journey started in the dead-end of a prison cell, just like Malcolm X.

    No blog post can do justice to the deep, rich, too-short journey of Malcolm X. But for today as we honor his contribution, it serves to remember that he too faced the same choice of millions: will I educate myself to become a better criminal or will I transform myself to become a better person.

    There is no doubt which choice Malcolm X picked, which remains one of the best reasons I can think of to honor him on his birthday.

  title: What can the Space Shuttle teach us about our future?
  subtitle: 'An excerpt from the book Illegal to Legal: Business Success for (ex)
    Criminals'
  author: R.L. Pelshaw
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Your strengths are found in your past, both good and bad. I’m not here to beat you up over what you did or might even be doing now. I’m here to give you a practical path that you can follow to help you use your past to propel you to a new future, your destiny, a future where you have left your past behind you.
    Take a moment and think about the Space Shuttle. Obviously, the shuttle was not designed to stay on earth. It fulfills its destiny in the stars, not on the launch pad.

    What is the biggest obstacle the Shuttle must overcome to get into space? It’s not gravity but the weight of the fuel. The fuel weighs more than nineteen times what the shuttle weighs. It’s ironic because the shuttle needs the fuel to get into orbit, but the fuel is so heavy it becomes the biggest obstacle the shuttle must overcome to blast into space. Breaking through the atmosphere into its destiny is the most difficult thing the shuttle will ever do.

    Pretend you are the Space Shuttle. You’re designed and destined to be high above where you are now, but you’re stuck on earth. You’re on the launch pad, ready for something to get you moving. You are yearning for something better, knowing you don’t belong where you are now. You are unhappy that you can’t get to where you want to be but you don’t know how to reach the stars.

    As the shuttle you have to use your fuel to blast off, but what is that fuel?

    Your past, your life experience, is like the fuel in the Space Shuttle. If the fuel is properly used it can propel you into orbit, your destiny. If the fuel is improperly used it becomes dangerous, explosive, and can destroy the shuttle. If the fuel is unused it weighs you down and keeps you stuck on the launch pad. Life on the launch pad is an unfilled life. On the launch pad you’re never going anywhere, never changing, never doing anything differently, never improving, and never learning. All you are doing is wasting away and decaying while you ignore your destiny above you.

    You must decide if you want to let your past weigh you down, destroy you, or propel you to your destiny among the stars. What will you decide? Are you willing to do what it takes to make it legitimately, so you can reach your destiny, the life you were meant to live? Once the shuttle blasts off it cannot return to Earth until its mission is complete. A return mid-launch would be catastrophic for the shuttle.

    History gives us another example of the commitment required for success. Spanish explorer Hernan Cortez burned his ships when he reached the New World in the 1500s. You must have that level of commitment if you wish to reach your goal. Returning to the past should not be an option at all, no matter how hard it is to launch or break through to your destiny. Just as the Space Shuttle cannot return to earth mid-launch, and there were no ships for Cortez’ men to return to Spain, there should be no chance of you ever returning to a life of crime. Close that door forever! This book will show you ways to start your own business so you don’t have to return to or continue crime to make a living.

  title: Few repercussions for those who send innocent to prison
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    As we’ve been documenting on our web site for those interested, Tony Yarbough has made a strong transition back into society after serving his entire adulthood — 22 years — for the murder of his mother and sister that he didn’t commit.

    Many men would have been destroyed by the loss of family and freedom — and even hope — at the age of 18. Tony simply got stronger. His faith grew stronger. His courage grew stronger. He routinely encourage me, instead of the other way around, reminding me that God has overcome this world.

    All of that faith, strength, courage and focus will inevitably be brought to bear on the issue of prison reform. The Tipping Point, I write about often, just gained a powerful shoulder against it in Tony.

    “Consider me a part of Criminal U,” Tony told me recently. We still don’t know just what this is, but more are joining the effort.

    Tony’s focus moving forward is on a specific area of reform: immunity from prosecution for prosecutors themselves. Those that send the innocent to prison need to be held in account, he says.

    “If they are working for justice, why would they need legal protection?” Tony asks. “If police are using just tactics, why do they lie to coerce confessions like they did to me? Why aren’t they prosecuted when these things come to light?”
    Rest assured it’s a powerful question, especially after last week’s revelations that exonerated another man. The D.A. also released police notes that show they ignored facts about a real killer and hid crucial evidence, knowingly allowing the wrong men be sent to prison. I’m no lawyer, but these detectives are still receiving a generous pension in retirement with no threat of being held in account for grievous, intentional errors.

    it’s a question, I’m sure, that Tony will effectively raise moving forward. It’s one every taxpayer who sees on the news more and more exonerations, needs to ask.

    When Tony was freed from Attica one of the first thing’s he said was that he still needed time to grieve the loss of his mother and sister. He also made it clear, the real killer was never brought to justice. This latest case suggests police had a lead on the real killer that sent two brothers to prison, but chose to ignore it.

    It’s one thing to send men to prison — most often for life — for crimes they didn’t commit. It’s another to knowingly allow a killer to remain free. In the case of Tony’s mother and sister, their murder, who is still not known, but was identified by DNA, killed again several years later while Tony lost his early adulthood to the hell of Attica.

    The ripple effect of crime is bad enough. The ripple effect of criminal actions by those in power, we are just now learning, is so much more egregious.

    Consider this: What about those who sent Tony to prison? What happened to them during those 22 years Tony spent in a supermax prison?

    “The investigator who oversaw the probe, James Luongo, is now a high-ranking NYPD Inspector. The prosecutor was Suzanne Mondo, now a Supreme Court judge. Both declined comment (on Tony’s exoneration),” the Daily News reported.

    The arresting officer is retired, living on a pension, and still steadfastly denying that he set up the wrong men.

    So… talk to us about justice?

  title: Exodus project carrying the burden of reform
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Each state in the country bears the heavy weight of the revolving door of prisons. Each state has few resources and fewer successes in reducing that revolving door. Each state is weary that in more than three decades, while the inmate population in America has skyrocketed to epidemic levels, the rate of those returning to prison has stayed the same. Two out three people released from prison today will go back. That’s the fact and the needle hasn’t moved.

    But that doesn’t mean there are successes. In fact, it’s just the opposite. All across the country, small under-funded creative programs are having stunning success.

    The work of genuine reform is happening. We just need to see it,  value it and get behind it.

    Consider The Exodus Project, started by a former inmate [Julio Medina](http://www.etcny.org/Julio_Medina.html).

    It’s been touted on national news programs and visited by former presidents. It has been heralded for its success– and rightly so. It’s featured on an independent film,.”

    “If someone goes back, we failing,” Medina says on during the movie.

    The Exodus project website explains its mission, stating, “Like the Hebrews, formerly incarcerated individuals traverse their own personal wilderness, as they struggle with financial and socioeconomic obstacles before they reach the land of financial stability, repair family connections and reintegrate into larger society.”

    This is the hardest thing for inmates to truly grasp. The struggle inside is brutal and exhausting. We tell ourselves we’ve paid our debt to society. We walk out free. But as Medina rightly points out, we are a long way from the Promised Land. That debt to society isn’t paid. We’ve only paid the interest on a high-rate credit card. The paying  has just begun.

    The models for dramatically stopping that revolving door exist. The success of The Exodus Project is a fine example. But as Julio Medina would tell you, they don’t need more pats on the back. They need funding. They need support and most of all they need those in power to follow their lead and expand the reach of these programs that have proven their success in the daily lives of those they worked with.

  title: Tragic loss of man who wasn’t ‘done’
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    He told me he was “done.” But the addiction’s grip wasn’t done with him. And now he’s gone.

    A young father I wrote about a while back lost his life to his drug addiction early this morning. His infant daughter is now fatherless, and his mother–yet another mother–has to face the gripping pain of the loss of her son.

    I’m folded up inside upon myself, a clusterfuck of anger, sadness, disbelief and, if I’m honest, indifference, because sometimes that’s the only way to wade through it all without imploding.

    We knew each other only through letters, the first of which came when he was in county jail.

    “I’m so done,” he told me.

    I had my doubts. I told him as much. I tried to get him a sponsor he could relate to and who would help him. We both reached out. But he didn’t respond.
    The Bride had a chance to see him later and he said it had been a struggle. I guessed as much. But he was clear and determined, some of the resolve he showed in his letter had returned.

    Life is a storm. A raging fucking sea much of the time. We spend so much time like Ahab, hand in a vice grip, pinching ourselves so we can find something that grabs in this slippery world.

    Today the seas claimed another one. Too young. Too much potential unfulfilled. A wake of pain and sorrow left behind. A grieving mother. A fatherless girl.

    I can’t imagine their pain. I won’t begin to pretend it’s mine. I am a distant observer, yet still crumpled a bit by it all. The permanence of it. The lack of a mulligan.  This happened and it can’t be changed.

    So I just ask anyone who reads this to pause. Do you need that drink? Is it worth it? Do you really just use “recreationally?”

    I wonder now, seven years on the other side of sobriety, is it worth it? Why even play around with this killer of use and/or abuse?

    We think it won’t be us. We think, poor them. We shove it away. Until it is. Until it’s our son, our father, our funeral.

    If you are on the edge, contact us. We’ll do whatever we can to help you find the way to the other side. Just ask yourself, are you done yet? If you are, contact us. If you aren’t, think again, before it’s too late.

    In this storm of life, I hope we’ll all grip each other a little more, love a little more and do the best to make our way as best as can.

  title: Pell Grants for prisoners benefit all
  author: Halim Flowers
  contentAboveNewsletter: "> “Instead of allowing these disadvantages to fester in
    prison, we need new policies that are designed to foster positive change, giving
    those who are incarcerated the skills they need to re-enter society as productive
    members of the workforce. For example, the government currently bars people in
    prison from receiving Pell Grants, a counterproductive policy that should be reversed.”
    \n\n[Rubin and Turner in the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/robert-rubin-and-nicholas-turner-the-steep-cost-of-americas-high-incarceration-rate-1419543410)\n\nThe
    above statement was written by Robert Rubin, a former Treasury Secretary of the
    United States of America, and Nicholas Turner President and Director of the [Vera
    Institute of Justice](http://www.vera.org/). As I read the entire editorial, this
    statement stuck out to me the most because I am currently enrolled in college
    classes with Ohio University. I wrote a letter to President Obama in 2013 encouraging
    him to restore Pell Grant privileges to federal and state prisoners. What surprised
    me about the entire piece was that a former U.S. Treasury Secretary who is the
    current co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations could empathize with the
    state of prisoners like myself.\n\nThe cost of a decent and accredited collegiate
    education is very expensive. But it’s nearly impossible for prisoners in our country.
    At Ohio University, the current cost for just two classes is $1,700. Most inmates
    do not make that much money working anywhere within an institution factory in
    an entire year. Therefore, with no access to any financial assistance, prisoners
    are forced to remain at a GED/High School level of education in a modern economy
    that requires at least bachelor’s degree for most skilled jobs.\n\nAs a lover
    and student of words, it always struck me how various state “Department of Corrections”
    did so little to correct those that are in their custody. All studies show that
    prisoners that are able to obtain post-secondary education have lower recidivism
    rates and transition back into society more progressively. In a world where most
    occupations require you to submit job applications online, why do so many inmates
    in state custody not have any access to email nor the internet? These are valid
    questions to ask because if these citizens are not going to be rehabilitated to
    successfully return to society then why would we ever have a policy of returning
    them to our communities everyday to re-offend?\n\nWhen I was given the opportunity
    to participate in a collegiate program at FCI Fairton in which college professors
    from Cumberland County Community College entered the institution to teach credit
    courses for an associate’s degree, my productivity and utility as a human being
    increased drastically. I went from a young man with only a GED to a self-publisher
    and author of nine books within five years.\n\nMy personal story is a proof that
    education really works because through it I have been able to be equipped to fully
    understand the ripple effects of my crime, to accept responsibility for my offenses
    and to utilize my destructive past through my writings to dissuade at-risk youth
    in society from following my path of crime and imprisonment.\n\nIts time that
    we put a different face on the imagery that America has for its prisoners. I want
    to be the poster boy for all the great things that this country can produce from
    our prison systems. It is only through education that any human being can increase
    their self-worth and utility to the planet. I hope that we all can take one small
    step to encourage our federal and state legislatures to restore the Pell Grants
    to our incarcerated citizens that are returning to our communities."

  title: 'Rule #6: Be present'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    For years I had a love/hate relationship with New Year’s Eve. Now it’s pretty much just hate. But that’s changing. The love is rising again. Sounds complicated, I know, or perhaps just schizophrenic. But let me explain.

    Like most reckless alcoholics, I loved New Year’s Eve, a time of unabashed partying where most everyone else drank like I usually did. I could throw off my normal neurotic need to show how together I was when I drank – I lived in fear that folks would realize my happy-go-lucking heavy drinking was an actual problem—and let it all go off the rails for a night. That was the love part of the equation.

    Then the reality arrived. Things rarely turned out as I hoped. Year after year I discovered a litany of failed of expectations. New Year’s Day hangovers usually far outweighed the New Year’s Eve frivolity. As the countdown commenced and those seconds ticked away, a dark awareness of my unhappiness, my unfulfillment, my disappointment with the year (years) just passed and lack of hope for the year coming despite all the false, drunken bravado I could muster, set in. That was the hate part.

    A few times the hate spilled over into consciousness, disrupting the love before the big ball in Times Square began its famous descent. In 1993’s final moments and again in 2007, my depression spilled into words on a page, chronicling my bitterness, sadness and discontent precisely at a time when I was supposed to be filled with hope and expectation for the coming year. Most years I just drank it away.

    When I got sober, I learned to just hate New Year’s Eve. I spent each of the first four years in a deep sleep by the time midnight came, a Grinch that stole the Eve or some such foul creature.

    Then I began to think a bit more about the whole thing. Isn’t it ironic that the one holiday dedicated to the idea of being wholly present in the moment – to actually watch and celebrate a ticking clock – is also the holiday that we see the need to get blindly drunk? A coincidence? I don’t think so. Because I finally realized that the present moment scares the living shit out of us.

    So with that vote of confidence, allow me to introduce Rule #6: Be present.

    Thrilling right? Yeah, I didn’t think so. But necessary, very necessary.

    You might recall the Adam Sandler movie where he finds a remote control that allows him to fast-forward through the parts of his life that bother him. He is overjoyed by the discovery (after the requisite funny freak-out scene in these formulaic comedies). Soon he hits the fast-forward through his wife’s conversations and daily chores and time at work. It’s great, until the remote basically takes over, using his preferences as a pattern for auto-zoom. Before he can stop the madness he is old and bitter and alone and dying. Hilarious, right? But who would have thought Adam Sandler would hit on an idea of Eastern spirituality and capture it in a goofy movie?

    For centuries, Eastern writings have challenged the intense need in all of us to zoom through the parts of our lives that are most uncomfortable. The gurus figured out that our avoidance hinders our humanity. They understood that to truly live this life to the fullest one must live it in the moment. They challenge us to be present.

    Present is, in fact, like watching a ticking clock, fully aware that each tick is one tick closer to the end. This existential certainty, that we will die, is a significant rite of passage, a test. We learn to embrace the life we have left rather than fearfully try to create more.

    Too often we fail the test. We live our entire lives in the future tense. We build security for the future. We look to a future time when we’ll be happy. We strive for a future job, a future relationship, a future success or standing. We are perpetually striving, yet missing the moments that pile upon each other in a massive heap of missed opportunities for life. We invest time instead of live it as the gift given to us that it really is.

    Can we add any moment to our life through this investment?

    One of the best books I have ever read is The Sacrament of the Present Moment, by Jean-Pierre De Caussade, a 17th century French priest. It’s the only work of his that remains to this day. He likely didn’t intend it to be a book, but rather it was compiled as a series of instructions for the nuns in his care. In these scant 80 or so pages is a golden recipe for life. De Caussade wrote (in what must have seemed heretical at the time) that all the sacraments of the church were meaningless compared to the sacrament of the present moment. Our lives, he said, could be properly defined by nothing more than living in the moment, aware of the grace of God that is sufficient for all. The golden wisdom of the book is a motherlode, sentences upon sentences compiled as a collection of wealth. Consider: “Follow your path without a map, not knowing the way, and all will be revealed to you.”

    For a culture that expends so much of our life’s moments and internal energy focused on a future goal, how freeing it is to simply acknowledge there is no map. We don’t know what the future holds, so we are free… FREE… to live this moment to its fullest.

    Perhaps among all the things I write about in this book, no rule will be more difficult. Its difficulty however lies within us. We simply stop struggling with the future and become present, which quite ironically is the easiest thing ever once you stop struggling so hard. Within that present, the eternal present, philosophers call it, we find inestimable joy. Perhaps for the first time in our lives we really live.

    Try it. Take a day and dedicate to live it. Become a fan of your own life, as if watching your own reality show instead of trying to write, star, produce and direct it. It may be a day that changes your life. More likely though it will offer you a glimpse of what your life can be. A thousand more times you’ll race ahead, rushing back into the insanity and comfort of life lived in the future tense. But hopefully, more and more you’ll stop and pause and return to the peaceful present. Do it enough and you might just discover how to truly live your life.

    It wouldn’t be fair or accurate to deny that the present, frankly, sucks more often than not. If it were so wonderful why wouldn’t we just soak it in? Those present moments can be terrifying. The anxiety we work so hard to quash rushes in like a tide. We see ourselves in truth: the fat, the poverty, the disappointment, the compromises, the debauchery, the pain. This truth, this present moment, is what scares the shit out of us every New Year’s Eve. How any of us can survive this without getting shit-faced amazes me really.

    But… but, if we take a breath and let the fear rush on by, the true sweetness of the present begins to emerge. For me it was like a wildfire loosed upon the dry, neglected forest of my soul. It ran hot and wild and destructively laid waste to all the fiction about myself I created and propped up with heavy, steady doses of booze. I could do nothing but let it burn. But in the dark ash of all that destruction, my present moment began to bloom. Pushing up new through the soot were green sprouts of truth. My truth. My life. The one I was supposed to live all along.

    And that my son, is why this rule is so very, very important.

    I’ll conclude with true wisdom, again from De Caussade and a single wish: May you find the riches beyond your wildest dreams.

    “The present moment holds infinite riches beyond your wildest dreams but you will only enjoy them to the extent of your faith and love.”

  title: "#Ferguson debtors’ prison could again ignite reform cry"
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Civil rights lawyers in Ferguson, Mo. filed suit against officials over the outlawed practice known since the colonial times as debtors’ prisons, [according to National Public Radio](http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2015/02/08/384332798/civil-rights-attorneys-sue-ferguson-over-debtors-prisons).

    For the most part incarcerating a person over debt is illegal in this country, [according to the Supreme Court](http://www.npr.org/2014/05/21/313118629/supreme-court-ruling-not-enough-to-prevent-debtors-prisons). But that hasn’t stopped many municipalities from using the tactics to harass and dehumanize those behind their bars. The antics in Ferguson that have now resulted in a lawsuit may be just the type of high-profile case needed to raise awareness of this unjust practice of building defacto debtor’s prison in jails and prisons all across the country. Virtually any of the nearly eight million American under some type of court ordered supervision have experienced some form of the threat in one way or another.

    The most abusive and blatant debtors’ prison practices have been reported [in places like Alabama](http://kulturekritic.com/2014/03/news/alabama-town-puts-poor-people-in-prison-and-makes-them-clean-floors/), where they not only jailed people for being in debt but then made them work menial jobs to earn their freedom. The specter of fees, fines and building debt constitutes both an obstacle to rehabilitation but also a threat to freedom. It starts early from the moment a person contacts a police officer to their last day of court-ordered supervision and all points in between.

    While on parole or probation, sanctions can be issued for falling behind on fees. These brief sentences can cost a person his or her job, only exacerbating the problems when the five or ten days in jail are served. Total disruption over a few hundreds dollars can be the difference between someone staying on the path to a criminal-free life or returning to prison with a petty crime conducted in desperation.

    Most of these practices are legal despite how destructive the result. The whole financial system of oppression has to be reconsidered, especially when judges opt for the debt to society to be paid with time in prison instead of allowing pre-trial diversions that could keep someone in their job, place them in-house arrest and/or allow them to pay restitution rather than sit in a cell. But it seems we want that debt paid in both time and money and we want to keep that debt accruing interest like a bad credit card for as many years after the crime as possible.

    Ferguson is just the sort of battle zone for this basic issue of human rights to be dragged into the public consciousness.

    “The suit is filed on behalf of 11 plaintiffs who say they were too poor to pay but were then jailed — sometimes for two weeks or more,” NPR reported.

    The lawsuit claims that Ferguson officials “have built a municipal scheme designed to brutalize, to punish, and to profit.”

    Which may as well be written about the criminal justice system in this country, a billion-dollar boondoggle that has bilked tax payers for decades with little accountability and demonstrably poor results in the mandated task of “corrections.”

  title: 'Inspecting thoughts: change starts from within'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Prison reform is about change, taking a billion-dollar industrialized machine that doesn’t work and transforming it so that it does. But reform — and the responsibility for it — starts within each of the seven million people currently on some type of supervision within the criminal justice system.

    Each of us has to change if we want to see the system change as well. We have to change to break the cycle of addiction. We have to burn the bridge that beckons us back to the lives we lived right into a prison cell. We have to change the destructive, reckless, selfish things we do that hurt others. We have to, in short, change everything to truly be transformed.

    No system no matter how broken or perfect or somewhere in between can replace that individual effort.

    This truth came home to me recently when a host of things occurred that forced me deep inside myself once again. I turned a flashlight on the dark corners of my inner being and took another look around. I realized that on virtually every level I now think very differently than I once did. My thoughts have changed.

    It’s how I know I’m on the right track. Change starts within, not our hearts or souls or wills, but within our minds. The key to reform is thinking change. Our thoughts are our fuel: to do good or to commit crimes, to stay sober or to relapse, to help or to hurt. Every action starts first with a thought.

    Thinking change is the one type of treatment that has worked with convicts over the years. Thinking change has proven to be somewhat effective with addiction treatment. Thinking change is powerful enough to shape healthy lifestyles and to break criminal patterns.

    I’ll never forget the first day I went to an AA meeting. It was in prison. I didn’t say a word. I listened though. Across the table was a young man in his twenties who was just days away from being released. He spoke about the new life he wanted. He spoke of second chances. He described how he first came into AA in that very room and felt overwhelmed by the idea of sobriety.

    “I thought I’d never in a million years be able to say I’d never drink again,” he said. “But I can honestly say, I don’t want to drink again. I’ve changed.”

    My teeth ground against each other. You had that right, I thought. Not in a million years.

    About a month later I spoke for the first time in AA.

    “I’m grateful you all don’t expect me to have all the answers now,” I said. “Thankfully nobody is tossing a fifth of Grey Goose over the wire, so I’m still sober today. I can’t imagine never drinking again. It seems impossible. But I know I won’t drink for a while. So, for now anyway, I’m OK. I just hope that before I can take that next legal drink, I won’t want it anymore, as impossible as that seems to me right now.”

    A month later I learned that same guy from my first AA meeting was already back in Criminal U. He attended a wedding, drank himself stupid, stole a truck and took off at high speeds. In the truck was a kid. Reckless endangering of a minor charges coupled with others stacked into several more years. The thought of how divergent his goals were from his reality and the ensuing tragedy of his life weighed on me for days.

    Not me, I thought. No fucking way. I got serious about rehab. I did the work. When the World Series came around, I skipped a game to go to AA. I never missed. I spoke that night too.

    “Right now there about two million people in AA,” I said. “And there are about two million people in prison. I’m never coming back here so I figure I better get serious about being in that group of folks in AA.”

    Fast forward a couple more months. It was my turn, my last AA meeting, my release coming. I thought back to that first meeting. I told about my first meeting and what I thought.

    “My thoughts are different now,” I said. “In a couple of days I will be out. I’ll go to a restaurant. For the first time in twenty years I won’t order a drink. It scares the hell out of me, but I will not forget that first meeting. I still don’t know how I’m never going to drink again, but I know I’ll do whatever it takes to stay out of here.”

    I got out and didn’t drink. Months stacked on months until recently, I found myself watching a World Series game in a restaurant filled with rowdy people drinking and celebrating. It hit me. I didn’t want to drink. My thinking had truly changed that much. What I once found unimaginable now reflects exactly how I think. The change had come from within with a few small thoughts, like seeds, that grew into a harvest of reform.

    It stuck. Thoughts are powerful. Sometimes its the only change we can make, but making it can make all the difference.

  author: Andrew Bolsinger

    The Innocence Project likely will get involved with the Brooklyn, N.Y., district attorney’s office in cases where DNA can prove the innocence of wrongfully convicted individuals.

    Paul Cates, a spokesperson for New York-based Innocence Project, made the statement in response to inquiry from The NorthStar News & Analysis, following the exoneration of Antonio Yarbough and Shariff Wilson.

    The two men recently were released from prison after 22 years for a wrongful conviction in a triple murder after DNA excluded them as the killers. New York City police allegedly coerced their false confessions.

    Kenneth P. Thompson, the Brooklyn District Attorney, may bring in outsiders to help re-investigate other cases that could involve wrongful convictions.

    > “It’s good to have someone from outside the office to help with the re-investigation. I am sure some of the assistants [who allegedly were involved in the wrongful convictions] are still with the office, but just in general, it’s hard for DA’s office to be objective when reviewing past ones [cases],” Cates wrote in an email. “It is just hard to break out of the tunnel vision that occurs when law enforcement gets fixed on a subject.”

  title: Foodie culture imitates prison spreads
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I took a strange box of stuff with me the day I left prison, a storage container loaded with the worst food ever: processed cheese, tuna packets, pepperoni sticks, mayo and Maruchin ramen noodle packages, among other things. Going back into the world where I could eat anything, I wanted to have a box of the only “special” stuff I could eat for the past 51 months.

    It was strange. I had to sneak it out because not leaving your stuff to those left inside is a really park bench thing to do. But it was important. I wanted some of my family to taste actual prison spreads — and in the back of my mind I was already planning the recipes and pictures needed for a [new ebook called Prison Spreads 101](https://www.amazon.com/Prison-Spreads-101-culture-recipes-ebook/dp/B00GS7QH06/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1504811626&sr=8-1&keywords=prison+spreads+101).

    Of all the things I made, the one that got the most fervent reaction against was what I had considered the best food I’d made inside: Ramen Tuna Sandwich. A whole email chain among my family ensued with one simple theme: Barf.

    I kept insisting they didn’t know what they were missing.

    Now, it turns out, I have proof. I was poking around some foodie websites the other day and happened across one of those new trends of exotic new ideas in food. It was the Shoyu Ramen Burger, which “made its debut in New York” recently. “Over 200 people showed up in the rain to try one of these things,” the blogger noted.

    Delicacy outside the barbed wires and bars? Apparently. A hot new New York craze. Inside the barbed wires and bars it was considered a delicacy as well. We called it a spread. But the reality is life inside and life outside aren’t as different than we might think. Recognizing and building on those connections erects a critical bridge to criminal justice and prison reform. Only we recognize the commonality, the humanity, the possibility that lives in those cells do we discover the empathy to consider change.

    My wife and I hosted a football game shortly after I got out. I made all the food using nothing but prison canteen items and tools we used inside, meaning hot water only, a broken ruler for the knife and the top of an Ajax lid for a cheese grater. Its was fun, a little nod to how my life had been so different from theirs. I made a cheesecake that most said was merely OK. A little bland.

    I laughed. They were right. They were comparing it to all the options of decadence we have outside. Inside, it was “to die for.” When I made it, guys would offer big bucks to get in on the spread. I got a letter from a friend inside the other day. He was the only guy I left the recipe (which had been a closely guarded secret) with when I left. He wrote, “Every time I make the cheesecake it’s a huge hit.”

    Just the fact we could make cheesecake without refrigeration and with a very limited list of available ingredients still astounds me. They way it brought folks together in friendship inside, that still astounds me as well.

    Why [Prison Spreads 101](https://www.amazon.com/Prison-Spreads-101-culture-recipes-ebook/dp/B00GS7QH06/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1504811626&sr=8-1&keywords=prison+spreads+101)? Because around the table, even ifs its processed foods served on a flap of a cardboard box, is where people come together and great things begin to happen, which is usually the same as how things begin to happen out here as well.

    We aren’t as different as politicians would want us to believe.

  title: Inmate Champions do God’s work
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I call them champions. I think angels is another appropriate term, but in my experience, I was blessed with several angels, but really only had one champion during my time in Criminal U.

    Inmate champions are rare, essential, unfathomable and remarkable. Yet when I look around, I see plenty of them and each and every time they fill my heart with gratitude.

    What’s an inmate champion? It’s the indefatigable person on the outside who simply never gives up advocating for the person on the inside.

    For those who have never been, it’s difficult to fathom the powerlessness of it, but here’s one short example that helps: I kept a list called the “Google list” when I was inside of nonsense arguments that I’d have with friends that we simply couldn’t get the accurate information to solve the debate. On the outside you’d hit Google. End of debate. Inside, it would linger for days.

    An inmate champion hits google for you.

    Most frustrating? Simply trying to call your lawyer, most of whom can’t accept direct calls from inside. My appeals lawyer could only be reached through a voice mail prompt, which is impossible because the person being called has to hit a prompt to approve the call from inside. I had several times when my robot was talking to to my attorney’s robot in an endless loop.

    My inmate champion called my attorney.

    She put money on my phone even when the calls went to other people. She put money on my books and sent me books. She took the time to understand the legal issues I was dealing with and took the time to communicate my needs to those on the outside who might help.

    When my friends were getting out, she’d champion for them too… in many ways. One of my buddies sent her a photo saying thanks for your Adopt a Puerto Rican program.

    Long before I got out, she and my wife envisioned everything Criminal U would be. They told me about it, how important it was that we eventually become champions for others. I had no interest. I told them they didn’t understand, even though they understood better than I did at that time. I told them all I wanted to do was get away from inmates once I got out. I told them I didn’t want my life to be defined my biggest failure.

    They didn’t listen. Now we are all inmate champions. Criminal U exists because of them, who both contribute still to the effort.

    Inmate champions do God’s work. How do I know? Read it for yourself. “Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body.” (Heb 13).

    I never really understood why at times in Scripture widows, orphans and prisoners are joined together. Why these three? Now I get it. One word joins them: Powerless.

    Inmate champions provide the power.

    You can never fully say how grateful you are for an inmate champion, but because they are doing God’s work, I suspect She’ll bless them accordingly.

    I was blessed. I have a beautiful wife that stood with me. My family forgave me and stayed true. My kids came to visit and insisted I call. They shared their lives with me. Friends wrote me.  Old friends I lost touch with came back into my life. My brother and I grew close. My parents pitched in to my legal fund. I had so much help (unlike the vast majority of inmates).

    Even angels came to visit me in most unlikely forms. When I needed it most I developed a few pen pal relationships with unexpected people– a cousin, a stranger, a friend-of-a friend, a pastor I hadn’t met — who propped me up and encouraged me.

    But I had only one champion, my oldest daughter Amanda, who simply refused to let me flounder.

    I worried often for her. She knows more about me than a daughter should ever have to know about her dad. She read my court documents. She knows all my skeletons. She had to support me instead of the other way around.

    I worried often, but I knew how much I needed what she did. She was my champion. She was with me at the start (My last free New Year’s Eve, deep in my alcoholism, a Tony Soprano lookalike headed toward the same early death):

    She was with me inside cheering on my transformation both physically, mentally and spiritually. And this past week, she was with me in a celebratory run through the city we both love and call home. This run was a culmination of all she’s done to help me through this dark, necessary time in my life. And she was the one person I wanted to be there as we raised our hands in victory at the end of truly celebratory 12K run.

    Amanda, my thanks. Always.

  title: Homeless dinner wrong place for police presence
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Twice, in less than a week in the city of San Francisco, I watched as police noticed a homeless man on the street, approached rapidly, forced the man to the ground, cuffed him and then searched his belongings. In both cases, after about ten minutes, the men were let go. In neither case did outward behavior attract the police’s attention.

    Both times I wondered: how would this interaction have been different if the man was in a suit?

    I’m no expert on the law or police conduct, but how much more likely is a man with a suit to raise hell with the police superiors, notify the press and/or file a lawsuit? So how different will his interaction be with the police than two instances noted above?

    But here was the real rub. The second time happened on the sidewalk of the Old Presbyterian Church just as it opened its doors for a dinner for more than 100 of those that live on the streets in the neighborhood. The man put in cuffs had been waiting for the food. He didn’t go in after the police let him go.

    Coincidences may not add up to anything. But I was there to cook that meal. I arrived three hours before the dinner and homeless folks were everywhere, hanging out, asking what was on the menu. It was a good vibe. There wasn’t a single member of the police force around.

    After a couple of hours of cooking hearty Shepherd’s Pie, we slipped out for a coffee. Even more people had lined up and there wasn’t a police officer in sight.

    On the way back from the coffee shop, a man approached me for a few bucks to get something to eat. I invited him to the church.

    “I just made it, it’s good.” I said. “Come eat with us.”

     “No, no. I can’t go in there. I had an altercation with the cops a while back and I can’t never go in there,” he said.

    We talked about it. I decided not to push. He may be right, and I didn’t want to get him in trouble.

    “Hang out right here,” I said. “I’ll go get you some food.”

    So I did. I loaded up a serving in my empty coffee cup so as not to attract attention, grabbed a plastic fork and went outside. Coming out is when I saw the police put the man in handcuffs. I went back around the corner to find the man I promised the food to, and he was nowhere in sight. I went clear around the block. He was long gone. In his place? Five police cruisers. One on every street with several police walking up and down the block.

    Did the police target the place because they knew the homeless would gather there? Or worse, were they called there for “protection” from people who just wanted to have a decent dinner?

    I went back to see whether the guy in cuffs would get arrested. They let him go. He ran behind a fence and hid, obviously a bit freaked out. I followed him and offered him the food. He was puzzled and frenetic and struggling on many levels. He offered a sexual act for repayment for the food and got a little testy when I declined.

    “Just eat the food,” I told him. “You’ll feel better.”

    As I walked away he finally said, “Thanks man. Thanks.”

    Then he told the people who were with me, “That thug looking guy gave me food.”

    I sent an email request into the media contact and dispatch for the district precinct where the church was located asking simply if they had been called or whether they chose to send five cruisers to a tame neighborhood where homeless gathered to eat a warm meal.

    They never responded to my request for information despite using my press email address and identifying myself as a reporter.

    I stress: None of this stands up in court as evidence of police misconduct or nefarious behavior. These are just my observations. But these are observations that repeat themselves. They stand in sharp contrast to the message I heard from a police spokesperson at during an interfaith meeting on homelessness attended by more than 200 church and civic leaders in San Francisco.

    San Francisco Police Lt. Mike Nevin, a veteran of the force for 20 years, said officers in the city have to be sensitive to the needs of the homeless, stressing that any cop who doesn’t understand that “won’t be working in this city for long.”

    Nevin said police are limited to what they can do in an interaction.

    “All I have is a tag book and a pair of handcuffs and I can tell you that is not going to solve this problem,” he said.

    Granted. Police aren’t social workers. But when they seek out homeless people, when they first place them in handcuffs, when they search without probable cause–all actions I’ve never seen them do down in the financial district on a Friday during the power lunch scene–they are not only failing to solve the problem, but they are contributing to it.

    The talk is not adding up to the action on the street. Until this disconnect is resolved by the police themselves, harassment of the poor will continue in a city that prides itself on its compassion and service.

    Is it OK for police to approach–either aggressively or politely–certain people for various reasons of appearances that at the least is dehumanizing but at worst leads to police harassment, false arrests and/or illegal searches? Is being homeless probable cause for searching their belongings? For ending up in handcuffs, even if for a short while? For being antagonized? Or for police showing up right before needy people enjoy the one decent meal they could count on? Is it OK to scare homeless people off the streets and back into the alleyways if you are wearing a badge?

    Apparently so, and that is a serious problem deserving far more attention moving forward.

  title: Politicians for hire? Prison lobby thinks so
  author: R.L. Pelshaw
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    A *Washington Post* article “How For-Profit Prisons Have Becomes The Biggest Lobby No One Is Talking About”  published April 28 confirmed that Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and The GEO Group (GEO), the two largest for-profit prison companies,  collectively have donated $10 million to politicians since 1989. They also spent $25 million lobbying politicians since 1989.

    I’m assuming this number only accounted for monies given directly to candidates and not their Political Action Committees (PACs).Who knows how large that number is? This makes the private prison lobby a very powerful force in the political arena, up there near big oil and the NRA.

    Federal election regulations limit the amount of donations private citizens and corporations can give directly to any candidate. Most politicians are skirting getting around that by having PAC raise and spend money on their behalf. There used to be limits on the amount of funds that could be funneled that way, but the rules were lifted by the Obama Administration early in the first term.

    Here’s what the *Washington Post* reported on Sen. Marco Rubio, an up-and-coming Republican presidential candidate:
    > “The U.S. senator has a history of close ties to the nation’s second-largest for-profit prison company, GEO Group, stretching back to his days as speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. While Rubio was leading the House, GEO received a state government contract for a $110 million prison. This occurred soon after Rubio hired an economic consultant who had been a trustee for a GEO real estate trust.”

    Rubio has the distinction of being the recipient of the most campaign contributions from private prisons, having received $40,000 in campaign contributions from GEO as of April 2015.

    So is it surprising that in a leading book about prison reform, Rubio took pains to argue against reduction in drug laws, widely believed to be inhumane, racially targeted and far too extreme, even by members of his own party.
    “I personally believe that legalizing drugs would be a great mistake and that any reductions in sentences for drug crimes should be made with great care,” Rubio wrote in *Solutions, American Leaders Speak Out On Criminal Justice*.

    Funny, I thought politicians were more expensive than $40,000. The sad thing is: how can anyone truly get fair judgment when big companies’ profit depends on a growing flow of incarcerated people?

    All talk of prison reform must center on those who profit the most from it. Profits are rampant and beyond debate at this point. Case in point: Last year, a judge was sentenced to prison after being convicted for receiving millions in bribes for sending young blacks to prison. They are overturning about 4,000 cases this judge ruled on because of it.

    I’m a capitalist, and I don’t mind anyone making money, but not at the devastating cost that incarceration extracts on families and society. A felony conviction is a life sentence in the job market, forever keeping us from the best jobs. That’s why I advocate inmates starting our own businesses, start hiring people, and start building political influence to change the system.

    We can’t expect the system that created the problems to fix it. That’s something we must do. We have to do it before the for-profit prisons buy enough politicians to perpetuate the poverty to prison pipeline, and the catastrophically high 75 percent recidivism plaguing our country.

  title: DC joins ‘Ban the Box’ effort
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Washington D.C. City Council, led by Councilman Kenyan McDuffie, passed a law to ban the box on job applications that require applicants to disclose their criminal history.

    The effort, called the Fair Criminal Records Sentencing Act, which finally succeeded against years of opposition, is an effort to significantly lower recidivism among those re-entering society after an arrest and conviction.

    Earlier this month, McDuffie’s amendment of the Fair Criminal Records Screening Act, a product of the Ban the Box movement, made it through the D.C. City Council, according to a report in The Root.

    “An employer may not make any inquiry or require an applicant to disclose or reveal any criminal conviction until after making a conditional offer of employment,” the legislation reads.

    Nationwide 60 different cities and counties, with [12 states](http://www.nelp.org/page/content/banthebox/), have passed ban the box legislation, according to the National Employment Law Project.

    “If you look at the data, one of the primary factors that contributes to recidivism is the failure to gain meaningful employment,” McDuffie, a Democrat, said. “This measure is designed to address that, to prevent employers from disqualifying individuals with records without fully considering their qualifications.”

    “For years we’ve said that if you commit a crime and serve a period of incarceration you’ve paid your debt to society, and in reality it’s not the case,” the Ward 5 native added, lamenting that such former prisoners often don’t have the opportunities to compete fairly.

    Democratic Councilman Tommy Wells of Ward 6 first introduced the bill in January. The council’s Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety in May changed the language to permit a background check after the first interview, weakening a key part of the bill, which had stressed that employers could review criminal records only after a job offer, according to The Root.

    McDuffie’s amendment puts the pointed language back in, proposing a background check only after a conditional offer of employment.

    “In a nutshell, I think we have to be smart on crime,” McDuffie said. “For years the war on drugs has ravished communities across the country, and D.C. hasn’t been an exception.”

    As part of the collaborative effort to return inmates to productive society, Criminal U has helped launch an innovative new campaign called Inside Innovations. You can join the movement in TWO powerful ways:

    1) Donate at least $5 as a vote of support to civic leaders considering whether to let this powerful program inside their prisons.

    2) Tweet, like, tout, share and email everyone you know asking them to offer support.

    It takes less than five minutes and five bucks but could change lives that filter back to communities with a ripple effect of positive change, tax-payer savings and a vision for genuine badly need prison reform.

    Join the movement!

  title: 'Police tactics on trial: Thomas acquitted for murder of son'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    After six years in prison and the loss of his family, Adrian Thomas got his life back on Thursday when a jury acquitted him of murdering his infant son back in 2008, as I reported in a story on [Your Black World](http://www.yourblackworld.net/2014/06/black-news/after-six-years-in-prison-and-retrial-new-york-father-acquitted-in-infant-sons-de%ce%b1th/). Now it’s the police tactics that need to stand trial.

    Thomas has spent every night behind bars since the night his son died. He spent the agonizing first hours being grilled, coerced and threatened by police who told him lie after lie to bate him to confession, including two whoppers: First, that these things happen and that he’d go home as soon as he admitted through his four-month son on the bed too hard. Second, that his son’s life hung in the balance and if Thomas didn’t tell the truth, his son could die (his son was already dead, which the detectives knew but Thomas did not).

    The police tactics were effective, if one considers getting a father to confess to a murder he did not commit is the intended goal. Thomas confessed.

    Then he went to prison for 25 years to life.

    Six years later Thomas is now free, but he is also divorced and his five other children and step children have believed he killed their brother that night.

    These things can never be undone. The police tactics were ruled so beyond the pale of acceptability by the New York court of appeals that Thomas got his retrial. But kids aren’t a jury; they don’t hear the instruction from a judge to ignore all you’ve ever known about your father.

    This is the humanity-crushing, family-destroying, life-altering result of police who decide guilt for themselves and then set out to prove it, rather than the way we all thought police tactics worked: like the so-called heroes on TV, police actually let the clues point them to solve the crime.

    In this case, as a jury ruled this time around, the most telling clue was that Thomas’ son died of sepsis, a brain infection. He did not die because his father threw on the bed. Police didn’t care about that clue. They decided the guilt and set out to prove it.

    A compelling documentary called *Scenes of a Crime* documents the nine-hour interrogation and expertly, chillingly, captures the moral issues involved in this case.

    The New York courts are considering how far is too far for police who lie to coerce confessions. The line is so, so FAR. And yet still, the police in Thomas’ case crossed it.

    Only when people of good will start to wonder, “what if that was me?” will the courts seriously consider moving that line much closer to the reality that the rest of the world lives in on a daily basis.

    Thomas can rebuild his life and even be a better man because of this. But for anything but destruction to result, the issue of acceptable police tactics must be on trial next.

  title: 'Criminalizing societal problems: laws against homeless rise'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    It stands to reason that a society that criminalizes business, politics and addiction would especially criminalize poverty.

    Of course, nobody comes right out and says it, but an abundance of laws make it easy for anyone at the whim of an officer to be issued a citation or sent to jail.

    At a recent conference on homelessness in San Francisco, numerous examples were given. One woman who was pregnant when she became homeless because of domestic abuse described her arrest for sleeping in the city named for St. Francis, who gave up his wealth to live the life of a homeless beggar. After being booked and released 12 hours later she was sent out into the middle of the city in the middle of night without a single belonging. Her sleeping bag and meager supplies were kept for “evidence,” she said.

    Tickets “shackle (homeless people) to the streets,” said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, http://www.cohsf.org/ who described ramped up arrests, increasing laws against sleeping, parking cars over night and loitering in public transportation terminals as examples of laws targeting the poor.

    A recent news article by the San Francisco Examiner offered support for the anecdotal evidence discussed at the conference.

    “In the past four-plus years, the number of citations issued by the Recreation and Park Department for sleeping or camping in San Francisco’s open spaces has increased six-fold,” the Examiner reported on May 4.

    The problem is how little effort the media puts into stories like these, when it bothers to report on it. This cover story pictured a couple in their tent on a busy street corner in the Tenderloin. Problem is this couple and this location had nothing to do with increased ticketing in parks. The disconnect slipped by the editors or they just didn’t care or didn’t think we care.

    We care.

    Would any other cover story on an urban daily newspaper that pictures someone not involved in the story be tolerated? But when we see “the homeless” as something less than human, such inconsistencies occur.

    I met those same people, their tent pitched on the same street corner, with the [Night Ministry](http://www.sfnightministry.org/) a few nights later. We talked. They seemed pretty human to me. In fact, they were cold and wondered if we could find them some blankets. We did. They said “thanks.” It was nice. Pretty damn human, really.

    The first step in criminalizing homeless people for being homeless is to dehumanize them. We call them “the homeless.” We speak of how annoying and dirty and crazy they are without asking how annoying, dirty and crazy we’d be if we didn’t have a place to sleep, shit and feel safe every night.  We see a problem and an inconvenience rather than a whole bunch of people in need. We sure as hell don’t see our responsibility.

    So we make the annoyance a crime.

    We ramp up legislation geared to ridding the city of its “homelessness problem” by simply ridding the city of homeless. At least that appears to be the agenda of pro-tech, pro-business Mayor Ed Lee.

    “The park citation increase directly coincides with Ed Lee’s tenure in the Mayor’s Office,” the paper stated.

    So it isn’t much of a shock that when plans for next January’s Super Bowl City in downtown San Francisco were announced, Lee said homeless people who reside in those areas [would have to move](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/04/22/mayor-lee-no-room-for-homeless-in-super-bowl-50-fan-village/).

    “I think for the benefit of the thousands, there won’t be any room,” Lee said.

    Plenty of room for wealthy tourists but no room for those who live on these streets every day. Nor is there any room in the existing homeless shelters and places they can go.

    I’ve met the people who live in what will be the Super Bowl party site (note: the actual Super Bowl will be played 50 miles away in a horrid site the 49ers chose while thumbing its nose at the city of San Francisco). They are people, with distinguishing characteristics. They are homeless people, not “the homeless problem.” Many choose this location because it’s safer than other areas and it’s quieter, the same reason many of us choose where we live. What’s so crazy about that?

    Mayor Lee can’t be bothered though. Police came through the area and kicked homeless residents out just for Lee’s announcement. Forget the “room” they just aren’t photogenic enough for the photo shoot.

    Nevermind a community of people exist at the center of what will be Super Bowl 50’s eight-day party. Nevermind [the church that meets here regularly](http://www.homelesschurch.org/), run by homeless residents. And nevermind that those who want to stay where they live will be arrested and placed in jail for violations like sleeping or peeing or parking or whatever else gets in the way of a good football tailgate party.

    The problem of “the homeless” can wait. Are you ready for some football? At least the Mayor of the City of St. Francis has his priorities in order.

  title: The joy of crossing Vin Scully off my bucket list
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Shortly after I went to prison I started a list on the back of a letter I received because it was the only paper I had at that time. I’m a notorious list maker — in my head, on scratch paper, on my hand, if necessary — about virtually any topic that comes to mind. I have to-do lists everywhere.

    I’m not sure what compelled this list, but I recall what was first on it: “Listen to a Dodgers- Giants game called by Vin Scully on a sunny afternoon.”

    It started a type of bucket list, things I wanted to do once I regained my freedom. On the list are some items I can’t do like have a Sam Adams with my son in those new glasses they made specifically for their beer. I wasn’t too interested in sobriety back then as I am now. Some will take years to cross off. Some have already been removed. But the list grew. About a year later I shared the idea with my brother who came to visit in me in prison. I told him about Vin Scully. He winced.

    “He’s retiring this year,” my brother said.

    My heart dropped. I couldn’t wrap my mind around the idea of not being able to recapture my youth and listen to the magical verbal stylings of Vin Scully call a baseball game.

    As it turned out, he decided to delay his retirement, much to the delight of all Los Angeles and baseball fans everywhere, but none, I suspect were more thrilled than me.

    When the baseball season started this year, my first since freedom returned to my life, it was a sunny day and my Giants were visiting Chavez Ravine. I tuned into Vin Scully and delightedly crossed the first thing off my bucket list.

    Freedom has rarely felt so fine. Knowing more moments like this lay ahead, I wake up each day with a profound sense of gratitude, determined to do just a little bit better each day, be a little bit better person each day, make a little bit more of a positive contribution in a small attempt to atone for past mistakes each day.

    Today, I tip my cap to Vin Scully, the greatest baseball announcer the game has ever known.

    “There’s 29,000 people in the ballpark and a million butterflies,” Vin Scully said way back when during Sandy Koufax’s perfect game.

    Many call this the greatest baseball call of  the greatest pitched game ever. A maestro on the mound, described by perhaps the greatest artist of play-by-pay to ever paint a verbal canvas. (I used to have this whole transcript up on my office wall… enjoy).

    It’s amazing the baseball Scully has seen. I think if I had one of those wishes to meet anyone in history, it would be to watch a Dodger-Giants game in the sunny outfield with Vin Scully to hear incredible stories like these:
    Vin was the theme music to some of sport’s greatest moments, from the Gibson home run to the “The Catch” at Candlestick (with a football, not a baseball). Scully is a poet who has painted American sports, like these:
    Vin, I’m glad you came back to make this one item on my bucket list come true.

  title: Detroit police officer charged with sexually assaulting woman while responding
    to call
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    New York’s finest have been looking not so fine recently with dozens of convictions under review. But Detroit isn’t fairing much better. The latest black eye for the police department came this week when a Detroit police officer was arrested for sexually assaulting a woman during a domestic violence call.

    Detroit Police Officer Deon Nunlee was charged for his actions back in October. Nunlee responded to a 9-1-1 call by a woman who was the victim of abuse. Following protocol the officers separated the woman and her partner to get to the bottom of the story. It wasn’t protocol when Nunlee took the woman upstairs. While his partner interviewed the man, police believe Nunlee raped the woman, victimizing her for a second time.

    Think about that for a moment.

    The woman reported it the next day. The rape kit came back in February with evidence to charge Nunlee. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said he was “deeply troubled.”

    He’s troubled in part because it’s not the only bad acting by this force. Two other officers were charged with crimes this past month. I don’t doubt he’s troubled like so many good police that such corruption and criminality still exists behind the shield. But until police speak out against their own, it can and will continue.

    Despite knowing the real truth, Craig said the Nunlee assault was an “anomaly.”

    > Craig said this incident is not a reflection of the department. “This is an anomaly. This is not what our police officers do,” Craig said. “This officer who decided to engage in criminal misconduct does not represent the 2,500 or so sworn men and women who wear this uniform.”

    via [Detroit police officer charged with sexually assaulting woman while responding to call | Detroit Free Press | freep.com](http://www.freep.com/article/20140307/NEWS01/303070095/Detroit-cop-rape-911).

    Well he’s wrong. Like it or not, it is a reflection on the department. It does reflect on police.

    Sure most officers don’t rape those they are sworn to protect. But anyone following the news these days has seen the systemic problems haunting police departments around the country. Problems of police corruption. Problems of fraudulent arrests. Problems of police brutality. Problems of profiling.

    And it’s not the anomaly we’re told every time something like this happens. I’ve met former police inside Criminal U. I met one who used to arrest women, handcuff them, drive them around the corner and rape them. There are a lot of these examples inside prison. It happens too often to be called an “anomaly,” not just in Detroit or New York, but in police department’s all over the country. Each one that was caught was sent to prison with a news story calling it an anomaly. We can’t even guess how many aren’t caught.

    African Americans remain especially troubled by police. It’s a nasty, poorly kept secret that still in the 21st century, all over the country, blacks fear police. They’ve seen too much. Far too many have simply been pulled over and harassed for DWB… not DUI.. DWB. Driving While Black. Don’t think it’s real? Then you are probably not black.

    A badge too often strikes fear. Plain and simple.  Because the institutional racism is too profound, too deeply rooted.  The overwhelming statistics show disproportionate arrests, convictions and longer sentences for blacks than any other racial group.

    A beaten woman calls for protection and gets raped. That’s what happened. A young teen comes home and finds his mother and sister murdered. He is tossed into a super max prison for 21 years until he wins freedom. That’s what happened. Another man is beaten by police, coerced to confess, then the victim of police work a judge calls beyond shoddy, but there he sits still on death row. That’s what happened. These are all stories of fact. Stories you can read here on this blog. They are just the tip of this iceberg and represent the best reason why genuine reform is needed.

  title: The all-important tipping point approaches
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    A vital point of focus for Criminal U is that a tipping point is fast approaching. In short, it works like this:
    The Great Recession hit, and state budgets felt it the worst. In 2010, Time wrote a cover story on desperate municipalities declaring that from “Hartford to Honolulu” governments were going broke. Desperate for budget relief, they reluctantly eyed one of the biggest drains on their funds: the prisons.

    Politicians of every stripe knew the current system of mass incarceration was unsustainable. But as a New York Times columnist wrote in 2012, “the political will” for reform had not yet arrived. The long sting of potentially being accused of being soft-on-crime that dated back to the Willie Horton era still stuck fear in political analysts and advisors.

    Now as we turn the page toward 2014 and upcoming mid-term elections, the political will has arrived.  [Consider this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-mauer/88-years-mass-incarceration_b_4474132.html) from Dr. Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst at [The Sentencing Project](http://www.sentencingproject.org/template/index.cfm).
    > “By many measures, there is growing momentum for criminal justice reform. Changes in federal drug-sentencing policy, passed by Congress in 2010, will help to reduce sentence lengths and racial disparity. We hear less “tough on crime” rhetoric and budget-conscious conservatives are embracing sentencing reforms. The Attorney General has criticized aspects of the criminal justice system and directed federal prosecutors to seek reduced sanctions against lower-level offenders.”

    Just as the political will has dramatically switched in things like gay marriage and immigration, prison reform is coming. The billion dollar boondoogle of the department of corrections simply can’t be sustained.

    But as Dr. Ghandnoosh pointed out, optimism should be contained by a harsh reality. The current projection of 1.8 percent decline would take 88 years to return the prison population to what it was just in 1980 at the start of this era of mass incarceration. Below shows the prison population and the projections of where it’s headed:

    Eighty-eight years isn’t fast enough, not when human beings are stored in warehouses likes boxes of unused items instead of treated, rehabilitated and returned to productive society, which was the point of corrections before the “lock ’em up and throw away the key” craze became fashionable.

    Political will. That’s the tipping point when true change will come and a shift that will take far less than 88 years will occur. The only thing that tilts the political will is voters. Educating voters is the crucial step. Figuring out how to take people who simply don’t care to look at this and make it meaningful to them remains the hardest challenge.

    And that’s where the power of story comes in. Stories make us human again. We reconnect and see the similarities. We recognizes that life behind barbed wires and bars may be different, but the human element remains and gives us hope.

    Stories bring change — true stories of real people who refuse to be less than human — necessary for the political will to emerge.

    That’s why Criminal U exists — to tell the story. We need your help to share the story. Like us, tweet us, tout us and review us. By chiming in and sharing these stories, you become part of the tipping point of change and it doesn’t cost you anything but a brief click or a few thumb movements.

    Thank you for being the change we need in this world.

  title: 'The Prison Industry in the United States: Big Business or a New Form of
    Slavery?'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "I came across this recently:\n> Human rights organizations,
    as well as political and social ones, are condemning what they are calling a new
    form of inhumane exploitation in the United States, where they say a prison population
    of up to 2 million – mostly Black and Hispanic – are working for various industries
    for a pittance. For the tycoons who have invested in the prison industry, it has
    been like finding a pot of gold. They don’t have to worry about strikes or paying
    unemployment insurance, vacations or comp time. All of their workers are full-time,
    and never arrive late or are absent because of family problems; moreover, if they
    don’t like the pay of 25 cents an hour and refuse to work, they are locked up
    in isolation cells.\n> \n> There are approximately 2 million inmates in state,
    federal and private prisons throughout the country. According to California Prison
    Focus, “no other society in human history has imprisoned so many of its own citizens.”
    The figures show that the United States has locked up more people than any other
    country: a half million more than China, which has a population five times greater
    than the U.S.\n> \nvia [The Prison Industry in the United States: Big Business
    or a New Form of Slavery? | Global Research](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-prison-industry-in-the-united-states-big-business-or-a-new-form-of-slavery/8289).\n\nEvery
    word in this is spot on except one: New. There is nothing new about the epidemic
    incarceration that began as a response to the ill-advised “war on drugs” in the
    1980s and soon became a war on people as more and more problems were resolved
    by criminalizing them and sending people to prison.\n\nIronically the ONLY group
    that avoided the mass incarceration of America were the Wall Street barons who
    caused the Great Recession with reckless, knowing, intentional actions that made
    them rich and nearly collapsed a financial institution. Think I’m being extreme?
    Well it’s [an esteemed judge](http://bizlawnews.com/47871/federal-judge-sounds-alarm-lack-financial-crisis-convictions/),
    Jed Rakoff, who said that, not me.\n\nBut slavery? I never liked that comparison
    because slaves were innocents and most inmates are not (Though as Judge Rakoff
    said, far more than we want to believe are in fact innocents). The conditions
    in prison, while often deplorable, are nothing like the conditions of slaves.
    It’s a bad comparison. Such hyperbole hurts the effort of reform. Guards are quick
    to point out all the amenities inmates are given. They speak openly about the
    desire to see prison become harder not easier.\n\nNo, America’s prison industry
    is not slavery, though it borrows similar principles. It is however, most decidedly,
    big business. And like the Wall Street collapse itself, it’s perpetuated by those
    in power with reckless, knowing, intentional actions that will invariably — and
    soon — cause a Great Recession-like crash to the industry. Taxpayers are already
    bearing the burden, paying what amount to the vilified rescue plans that put nearly
    a trillion dollars into the economy to save it on a recurring basis every decade.\n\nBailouts
    cost taxpayers but brought a return. Banks were saved, pensions protected, stock
    reinvigorated and even a car industry saved. This bailout — the the tune of more
    than $51 billion a year — brings very little to society. Ninety-five percent of
    all those sent to prison will come back to society. Two-thirds will commit more
    crimes. The cost of that incarceration that does very little to rehabilitate anyone
    is staggering. But the big business, including private prison operators and vendors
    who are publicly traded companies on Wall Street, reap the financial rewards.\n\nSlavery
    no. Business yes. But the inmates aren’t the only ones exploited. The taxpayers
    get it far worse."

  title: 'Rule #3: Find your river'
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    When I was 25, I went through my “mid-life” crisis. At least that’s how I saw it then.

    I had all the classic symptoms even if it was ten years too early. I was unfulfilled professionally. I was the pastor of a church doing work I enjoyed, and yet didn’t feel right, like a coat with the sleeves just a bit too short.

    Looking back I hadn’t lived yet. I had settled into the type of job I’d love in my fifties after I had gotten my restlessness and ambition out of my system. My personal life was an even bigger mess. My wife and I had no connection other than our children. We shared no goals. We lived like that movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith, mostly polite but always wary, fully expecting the other to betray. I had several guys who I called friends, yet I was like that picture on the old child’s place mat in Denny’s, “Which one of these is not like the other?”

    Nothing about my life fit me. Even things I didn’t yet know about myself were at odds with the self I had become. We lived a simple, paycheck-to-paycheck existence, “serving God” as good Christians were supposed to do, in a rural area around well-meaning but mostly uneducated people. Read the allegory of Plato’s cave and you get a sense of what I was doing to myself.

    It took me another ten difficult years to break out of it all. By that time I caused a major scandal. It seemed “out of character” with me to do what I was doing: divorcing my wife, leaving my children, running across the country to start a new career, and living the “single life” I had missed getting married at twenty years old. But what I was doing was saving myself. I had spent years and years swimming hard to make a good life, but swimming in a river that wasn’t flowing anywhere near the direction my life and true “calling” was meant to go. I could no longer swim against the current; I needed a completely new course. I had to go through a fish-out-of water experience to find my river.

    I made the jump in a horrible way. I hurt so many others. I made decisions that would get me tossed into prison right when I was starting to figure my life out. I found my river, but way, way too late.

    Find your river. The earlier the better. As you enter fully into adulthood don’t rush to arrive. Instead, embrace the mystery; live the journey. Something in our culture destroys that inner urging to explore, to get dirty, to wander, to consider, to ruminate. We rush to achieve. We need status: A job, money, a wife, a home, a nice car, cool clothes. We need a description: I’m ___________, which is usually our job, not our vocation.

    But what about art, beauty, romance, passion?

    How can we expect to live a fulfilled life when most everything and everyone around us happened by chance, or as a result of childhood notions, parental expectations, and cultural obligations? How can an 18-year-old possibly know what he wants besides money, a cool car and the opportunity to get laid once in a while ? That’s all he knows.

    I’m willing to bet that an 18-year-olds hasen’t met his best friend yet. He hasn’t seen a place that touches his soul like a Native American returning to the hunting grounds of his tribal elders. He hasn’t felt the wellspring bubble from his very soul, saying to you “Yes, do that! This is what you were meant to do.”

    All of this is still to be discovered. Thank God!
    What a boring life it would be if we had it all figured out before our first legal cocktail. It would be like playing only James Bond on Nintendo 64 after you’ve beat all the levels for the rest of your life. Life still has PS4, Wii and beyond.

    What exactly do I mean by finding your river?

    I mean finding a journey in life that coincides with your soul’s urging. Gravitate toward those things that energize you, not just something you do to pay bills. Find a few close friends and even a lover who dances to drum beats similar to yours, rather than spending all your time with the comfortable and kindly people who just happened to share space with at this point in your life.

    Finding your river doesn’t mean you’ve figured out the meaning to your life. It means you’ve found at least the right water flowing in the right direction.

    Imagine you are given a complicated set of directions to attend a party you’ve been looking forward to for weeks. You start out. First direction is north on I-5. You head south. Every other direction is meaningless. You’re screwed. That the wrong river. The only way to fix it is to U-turn, admit the waste of time, shrug off the frustration and go north. Find your river then the rest of the directions will begin to make sense.

    You know that feeling in your gut when you know you’re lost, that nothing makes sense? That’s your gut telling you to find your river. After all that when you start to see the correct street sign a wave of relief comes over you. That’s your river feeling.

    For me it was writing and finding my soul-mate, and moving closer to all my children and living in San Francisco and a bunch of other turns I don’t even know about yet. For others it is different things. It’s up to you, and God, to find yours. “To thine own self be true,” the ancient philosophy states. Indeed.

    One final word of caution, Philosopher Sam Keen told a story about adulthood I find useful. It goes like this: “There are two questions a man must ask himself: The first is ‘Where am I going?’ and the second is ‘Who will go with me?’ If you ever get these questions in the wrong order you are in trouble.”

    Exactly, because you’ll end up in the wrong river for sure. Your “job” right now is not to be rich or famous or beautiful or brilliant, but to start out by finding your river. The rest flows from there.

    As Jimmy Dugan says, “Hey! That’s good advice.”

    __\nJV: I got involved with Defy Ventures in 2012 after I completed a two- and
    a-half-year prison sentence for heroin distribution. I enrolled in Defy Ventures
    first training here in NYC. I was able to start my own business, make my family
    proud and now I am part of the Defy staff as Dean of Admissions.\n\n__CU: As the
    Dean of Admissions, you work with many people getting out and many leaders of
    the business community. That is pretty rare, right? __\nJV: Correct. The great
    thing able these two worlds are the similarities that they share. Business is
    business. Regardless of what you are selling — oranges, stocks or drugs — they
    have the same components, so when we bring our executives to meet our entrepreneurs,
    connections are made instantly. Our goal is to transform the lives (and hustle)
    of business leaders and people with criminal histories through their collaboration
    along the entrepreneurial journey.\n\n__CU: Tell us about your success in NYC?__\nJV:
    Here are just a few of our success in NYC:\n• In two years, Defy grads legally
    incorporated 71 businesses and received $140,000 in start-up grants. Nearly all
    generated revenue within 90 days; the businesses generated 35 new employment opportunities
    for Defy grads and others.\n• 87.5% of grads gained employment and reported an
    average increase of 122% in annual income within 7 months.\n• We engaged 2,000+

    As well as the admissions director you are also an entrepreneur yourself. Tell
    a little about your entrepreneurial efforts.__\nJV: I’ve always had that entrepreneurial
    spirit through out my life. I started legal and illegal businesses, and I can
    truly say that what I have learned in the streets has helped me achieve things
    in my professional life that are incredible. The hard times I survived are what
    push me everyday. This is why I am not ashamed of my past.\n\n__CU: Preach! Is
    there anything vitally important I forgot to ask you about! __\nJV: No, great
    questions. I wanted to leave you with a few facts:\n•\tRoughly 100,000 juveniles
    leave correctional facilities, State prison, or Federal prison each year. These
    juveniles have a recidivism rate of 55 to 75%.\n•\t70% of children with an incarcerated
    parent will follow in their parents’ footsteps.\n•\tAfrican-Americans are nearly
    six times more likely to be incarcerated than whites; Latinos are nearly twice
    as likely to be incarcerated than whites.\n•\tIn some states, black men have been
    admitted to prison on drug charges at rates 20 to 50 times greater than those
    of white men. And in major cities wracked by the drug war, as many as 80% of young
    African-American men now have criminal records and are thus subject to legalized
    discrimination for the rest of their lives.\n\nThank you so much for helping spread
    the word in the Bay Area!\n\n__CU: And thanks for the work you do. __"

  title: 'Rule #8: Enjoy your company'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    From ancient philosophy to modern poetry serious thinkers have recognized that three is a crowd. That’s an oversimplification, of course, but it helps to consider the perpetual resistance people face when they go against the grain and learn to be comfortable alone.

    Nietzsche had his disdain for “the mindless masses.” Religions speak of the narrow way to heaven or enlightenment or bliss. Rebels defy conformity. Ray Bradbury’s *Fahrenheit 451* spoke of the wandering few who kept their individualism alive through books. Plato allowed one person to escape the cave. Frost advocated the less traveled road. Bumper stickers preach individualism.

    Take a good look around. The theme is ubiquitous. Go against the grain. Swim against the tide. Let your voice be heard. Then why, I often wonder, are people so damn afraid of being alone?

    In grade schools, churches, statehouses and prisons, I have seen old and young alike desperate to fit in. Nothing in new social settings seems to cuts as deep as being apart from the crowd. As children we dread sitting alone at recess. Is that so different than politicians fearful of being black-balled by their “party” by voting on the grounds of conscience? Or is it that different from an inmate eating alone in the prison chow hall, or a person sitting alone at church for that matter? Or going to a movie by yourself, or to a movie, or just about any activity where our isolation sticks out and rubs against the grain of belonging?

    This compulsive need to fit in exacts a tremendous toll in what appears to be the inevitable result of all of the above: We look to “the group” for what we think, how we act and who we like or dislike.

    Consider a different path. Consider Rule #8: Enjoy your company. Learn to be comfortable alone.

    Perhaps it’s just modern American culture (it’s the only culture I know) but I see people of all stripes of life utterly desperate to avoid themselves. We evaluate our worth by our “friends” and “followers,” most of whom we never see in human form.

    How many people once they’ve made up their mind to leave their significant other, first start up a new relationship to avoid the pain of separation? Men especially revolve between spouse, mistress and new object of desire as if promoting new trainees up the corporate ladder. I know I’ve done my share of trading one bad relationship for another.

    Things have gotten so dysfunction in this Social Network Age that the American Psychological Association has [addressed a new phenoma](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/06/social-networking.aspx), one called “alone in a crowd.” The story states that despite a proliferation of online social engagement, people are more isolated than ever, eroding our ability to live in a healthy manner when offline.

    We are a social creature. We can’t avoid the genetic coding within us that seeks relationships to a greater or lesser degree. We are fathers, sons, uncle’s nephews, brothers, cousins, lovers and friends at all times. But this swallows our identity when not forced into proper prospective. Instead of knowing ourself and offering our best self to the world, we become bland, one-dimensional chameleons, determined to fit in. We live without leaving fingerprints on the world; instead we look like someone who acid washed those prints to become completely void of uniqueness.

    A existential psychologist named Irwin Yalom greatly influenced my thinking back in my 20s as I struggled to understand who I was and who I wanted to be.  Fundamental to our own mental health is the acceptance of our individualism despite our desire for social acceptance. We are born alone and die alone, Yalom wrote. It can’t be avoided. In between we must accept the reality that try as we might, no one person, family or group will ever truly know us. They can’t live inside our skin as much as we try to fabricate it. Empathy, listening and caring remain important ways to connect with another human being, but they have their limits. At the end of the day, and at the end of our life we are alone.

    So it would seem to me life will be more enjoyable and manageable if only we’d learn to enjoy our company. If you don’t like yourself, you are like the episode of *Grey’s Anatomy* where two Siamese twins want to be separated because they are sick of each other!

    Robert Parker’s Spenser P.I. mysteries proved insightful for me over the years. Spenser is an iconic figure of individualism. He lives by his moral code. He values others, loves just a few, but relies on himself. He learns to cook well even though many nights he is making dinner for one. Why not? If you are alone shouldn’t you still eat well?

    As an introvert and someone who had a deeply neurotic ingrained intolerance for authority I have spent a lifetime fighting “the masses.” I’m a back row guy. I eat alone in cafeterias. I shove away “the crowd.” Yet only in the last few years did I stop my own desperate search to belong, if that meant a small exclusive circle of my choosing outside of the mindless masses yet still comfortably protected from myself. Only in recent years did I grow “comfortable in my own skin.” I learned to be comfortable alone, as opposed to forcefully isolated. Contained.

    I feel lonely at times. I still accept the small shiver of fear when I stare at my isolation in its purest form knowing I was born alone and will die alone and I can’t do a thing to change it. But I am at least in company I enjoy now. By being OK with being alone, I’m better around those I love. I can relate to them more honestly instead of desperately seeking to grab from them the balm to heal my aching isolation. By being better alone, I’m far better around others.

    And those masses? The bumper stickers and philosophers and authors and poets are mostly right. Be wary. Be wary.

  title: West Oakland fury, frustration boils to potential action
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |
    [Ardent residents of West Oakland](http://oaklandlocal.com/2015/03/frustration-boils-west-oakland-meeting/) filled the Willie Keys Community Recreation Center Thursday seeking answers to years of drug trafficking and attendant violence in their neighborhood.

    The meeting came in the aftermath of the killing of Chyemil Pierce, a third-generation West Oaklander and mother of three who was hit by a stray bullet while trying to shoo her children to safety.

    “It’s the same thing over and over,” Doug Taylor said, while another, Sennix Sams, shouted virtually identical words addressing Oakland Police officials.

    “Same thing. Some people. Same corner,” Sams shouted, despite appeals to keep civil.

    Applause broke out, seemingly less in support of the complaint and more to simply say the community has had enough of random violence.

     “It’s just dumb luck my neighbors haven’t been killed like (Chyemil Pierce) was,” Thomas said.

    It was a night of raw nerves, banged repeatedly by the stubborn nature of crime in urban areas. Criminal justice reform, and stubborn crime that by definition goes with it, defies easy solutions. While everyone in attendance wanted them, those offered by Oakland Police Chief Sean Whent and the area captain were widely dismissed as too much of the same thing that hasn’t worked before.

    “I want to recognize there is a lot of pain,” Oakland Councilmember Lynette Gibson said, reminding her constituents that she entered office highly critical of Oakland police. “There is room to be critical.”

    She also reminded them that these meetings must lead to solutions that will be both long-term and short.

     “I am a West Oakland mother,” she reminded them, citing her children and grandchildren live in the same community. “Let’s get that very clear. This is not esoteric for any one of us in this room because we are all aware it could have been one of our children.”

    You can’t talk reform without exposing the hurt that comes with it. Behind every criminal is a victim. Behind every broken law is a person with a potentially broken life.

    But “lock ’em up and throw away the key” hasn’t worked. It’s only fueled increased crime and community devastation, a cycle where 84 percent of men arrested under the age of 23 will return to prison.

    This tension, this delicate balance that seeks to humanize all involved, was on display as teachers at the local high school appealed for solutions and long-time residents admit they fear for their safety. The us against them notions that divide us, dividing the group in attendance just the same.

    Perhaps the best solution of the night came from someone who had been on both sides, Akil Truso, a former convict turned community outreach worker. His work with the West Oakland Street Outreach team represents the tip of the spear of relational building that is essential for genuine reform and decreased crime.

    “You have to deal with the Street Outreach Team so we can help build a relationship with the guys you are complaining about,” Truso said.

    He too was frustrated, but more with the nature of the discourse that wanted the crime gone without addressing what fuels it.

    “I look around and see no hope,” he said. “That’s me. If I can stop doing it, so they can they.”

    And that’s how reform will get done in this country.

  title: The double standards of guards and sex exposed
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Sex in prison isn’t funny despite rampant jokes about it.
    Somehow the idea of an inmate being violently raped doesn’t incite much anger
    among the populace, which is just another example of the way we dehumanize those
    behind the barbed wires and bars of America’s prisons. By making them punchlines,
    we don’t have to consider the human implications of our current system.\n\nThe
    myths about sex in prison are largely false. As [a study found](http://www.justdetention.org/en/academicarticles/Saum.aspx),
    most sex between inmates is consensual. The ole prison bitch yarn — while it certainly
    exists — is not as prominent as one might suspect.\n\nThe issue nobody talks much
    about, yet may well be more problematic is guards and sex.\n\nI only knew of a
    couple of inmates who had been victimized. When it happened it was news and it
    was usually grim. Far more often I heard of guards and sex. In our case it was
    consensual, a female guard or staffer with an inmate in some way or another. In
    one case, similar to the one mentioned below, the female guard was encouraged
    to claim rape to so the inmate could be charged. She instead quit, but she wasn’t
    charged.\n\nThe bigger problem with guards and sex is in women’s prisons, where
    consensual is far more murky. The reality is simple: if we care about protecting
    people from abuse, we need to look again to include those who are powerless, those
    behind bars.\n\nA recent article I wrote for Your Black World makes clear that
    there is nothing funny at all about sex in prison. What it does point out is the
    disparity we have even with how the guards themselves are treated. The layered
    complexity of problems within the prison system can be glimpsed here:\n> A female
    guard at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville, Tennessee, was
    arrested after it was discovered that she had sex with an inmate, according to
    a report by WKRN.com.\n> \n> Kenyette Foxe, 28, was charged with a felony sex
    charge for a pair of sexual encounters with Michael Daniels, 28, who is serving
    a life sentence for murder for the 2006 death of Adrian Patton.\n> \n> Foxe had
    worked at the prison for just over a year, according to WKRN.com. She had previously
    been in the military. Daniels is believed to be a leader within the Skyline Bloods
    gang. He was convicted of ordering fellow blood Timothy Evans to murder Patton.\n>
    \n> Foxe was booked into the Metro jail on $10,000 bond.\n> \n> The news of Foxe
    being charged stands in stark contrast to recent reports out of Alabama’s Tutwiler
    Prison of allowing “rampant” sexual abuse of approximately 900 female inmates
    by over one-third of the 99 male officers on staff, according to a report by ABC
    News.\n> \n> Inmates were “universally in fear for their safety” and were forced
    to have sex in exchange for sanitary supplies.\n> \n> “We conclude that the state
    of Alabama violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution by
    failing to protect women prisoners at Tutwiler [Prison] from harm due to sexual
    abuse and harassment from correctional staff,” the Justice Department wrote in
    a letter to Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley.\n> \n> Investigators concluded the Alabama
    Department of Corrections and officials at Tutwiler have been “well aware of the
    multitude of structural problems that allow this abuse and harassment to continue
    unabated.”\n> \n> “Officials have been on notice for over eighteen years of the
    risks to women prisoners and, for over eighteen years, have chosen to ignore them,”
    the head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acting Assistant Attorney
    General Jocelyn Samuels, said in the letter. In that time, inmates have been raped,
    sodomized and fondled by prison staff, yet officials “remain deliberately indifferent
    to the serious and significant need to protect women prisoners.”\n\nConsider these
    women. They have no place to hide and no hope of safety. How is this different
    than sex trafficking? How is this situation allowed to continue?\n\nWhen considering
    guards and sex, consider a report in January by ABC news that barely raised a
    blip of social media outrage. The results of this study is staggering:\n> Allegations
    of sex abuse across the country’s prisons are on the rise, with nearly half of
    cases allegedly being perpetrated by guards, according to a new study conducted
    by the Justice Department.\n> \n> The new Bureau of Justice Statistics report
    documented more than 8,763 allegations of prisoner sexual victimization between
    2009 and 2011, which they say is an 11 percent increase over the number of allegations
    documented in a report covering 2007-08.\n> \n> The study found 49 percent of
    the unwanted sexual misconduct or harassment involved prison staff as perpetrators,
    in acts ranging from verbal sexual harassment to the most serious nonconsensual
    sexual penetration.\n\nLike I said, there is nothing funny about sex in prison."

  title: 'Time Magazine got it all wrong: Les Bower executed'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The state of Texas finally got its wish today.

    It executed the oldest prisoner on its death row, inmate Les Bower, who had successfully stayed his execution seven times before.

    The eighth time was the charm for Gov. Rick Perry’s “smart on crime” state.

    Recently[, [Time Magazine’s cover story](http://time.com/deathpenalty/) was titled, “The Death of the Death Penalty: Why the era of capital punishment is ending.” The story’s careful reporting about the randomness of executions, even highlighted Texas as an example of the inevitable end to killing inmates.

    “Even in Texas, which leads the nation in executions since 1976 (when the U.S. Supreme Court approved the practice after a brief moratorium), the wheels are coming off the bandwagon. From a peak of 40 executions in 2000, the Lone Star State put 10 prisoners to death last year and seven so far in 2015,” the author writes.

    Make that eight so far. The so-called “random” decision of who gets killed wasn’t random in Bower’s case. The state centered on Bower and fought repeated appeals to the Supreme Court to ensure a man incarcerated for more than three decades was executed at an enormous cost to taxpayers.

    If there is one foundational truth that should be sacrosanct when it comes to the death penalty in our country it is this: if any possible doubt of innocence exists, the death penalty should be banned.

    It is hard to fathom how anyone could not have some doubt in this case, especially when a witness came forward to declare Bower’s innocence and finger the men involved in the killings, when prosecutorial misconduct is all but certain, when critical evidence was withheld for more than a quarter of a century.

    Nobody will ever know for sure if Bower’s claims of innocence were true. But few could argue against the notion that some measure of doubt remains about his guilt (for a compelling, detailed, insightful story on the case, see the article by Jordan Smith on The Intercept](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/01/lesterbowertodie/)).

    In light of more than 100 exonerations in our country in the last year alone, short of a prolonged, sustained confession and significant testimony or video evidence of the actual murder, doubt in our criminal justice system should be mandatory. By default we should doubt virtually every execution at this point.

    Instead, in a handful of aggressive states like Texas, Florida, Missouri and Oklahoma, the death penalty is carried out for its political points with conservative voters, justice be damned.

    The state of Texas got its wish today. That wish is precisely why the death penalty must be abolished. It’s an immoral wish that defies our most basic beliefs in justice. The United States is out of step with the times, out of alignment with other leading nations and out of touch with the gross injustice surrounding capital punishment, especially in deciding who among those convicted are executed and who is not. The U.S. can no longer claim to be the moral voice of the world when so many of its actions are so lacking in morality.

    Time Magazine got it wrong. The death penalty is far from dead. Les Bower is dead. And justice may be as well.

  title: 'Rule #14: Vote'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Vote.\n\nThis is so obvious I hesitate to write any further
    words and risk muddling a fundamental principle captured in a single word. Then
    I remember my career as a political reporter and recall election after election
    with far less than half of registered voters taking the 30 minutes from a single
    day to punch a few holes on a ballot.\n\nThen if that’s not enough I think about
    how millions of Americans have lost their right to vote because of past mistakes.
    Thoroughly marginalized and stigmatized, these folks– we’re brand with the name
    “felons”– can’t participate in the process of electing officials and helping to
    change laws that subjugate them.\n\nThe state’s vary on how long the ban remains
    in place, according to the [New York Times](http://www.governing.com/news/headlines/Eric-Holder-Asks-States-to-Restore-Felons-Voting-Rights.html):\n\n>
    “Nearly every state prohibits inmates from voting while in prison. Laws vary widely,
    however, on whether felons can vote once they have been released from prison.
    Some states allow voting while on parole, others while on probation.\n> \n> Some
    states require waiting periods or have complicated processes for felons to reregister
    to vote. In Mississippi, passing a $100 bad check carries a lifetime ban from
    voting.\n> \n> In four states — Florida, Iowa, Kentucky and Virginia — all felons
    are barred from the polls for life unless they receive clemency from the governor.”\n\nIt’s
    little wonder that in 2013 U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder appealed for these
    laws to be normalized and removed as a basic issue of civil rights. Without a
    vote, you are powerless.\n\nSo why do so many with the power refuse to wield it?\n\nYour
    vote exercises your duty as a citizen. It is a privilege afforded only a tiny
    majority of all humankind over the eras. It is a sword that wields stunning power
    against evil, the rise of dictators and the gavel of injustice. Do we really need
    more motivation than that? Apparently so, but I won’t belabor the point too much
    longer anyway.\n\nI’ve never been too keen on obligation. Obligatory action is
    often fraudulent; truthful action creates so much more clarity even if awkward
    or painful in the moment. But when it comes to voting, I’d enact obligation as
    my fall back of strategy. If all other points fail to motivate a citizen in a
    democracy to vote, then do it because you should and to hell with all the argument.
    As Nike says, “Just do it….damnit.” (My own interpretation of the Nike slogan).\n\nSimply
    put if everybody failed to vote our democracy would crumble. Since we are no more
    special than anyone else, we simply must do our part to protect it.\n\nTwo final
    points: First, few things are more irresponsible than an uneducated voter. The
    reason “swift boating” a candidate is now part of our lexicon is because voters
    are so unwilling to educate themselves just a bit, with fact rather than political
    spin. Covering elections I learned that campaign managers rarely worry about truth.
    Their focus sharpened instead on what they could make voters believe. Often they’d
    try to use reporters to make their case. The appearance of truth was more than
    enough, largely due to a strong majority of uneducated voters.\n\nIf voters are
    turned off by negative political, exaggerated claims and political spin they have
    only themselves to blame. If these tactics failed to move the needle, or even
    better moved it in the opposite direction of political polls, the practice would
    stop.\n\nSecond, never forget the war that has been waged throughout history for
    the right to participate in elections: The revolution of 1776, and the subsequent
    defense of the country in 1812. The suffrage movement that came one hundred years
    later and then the civil rights movement. The effort required of every naturalized
    citizen. All of these ultimately trace their roots back to the desire for freedom
    as expressed by the right to vote.\n\nVoting for 99 percent of all humankind has
    never been easy, yet we stoop to the level of mail-in elections just to make it
    easier for those not inclined to vote. Soon folks will try to make it possible
    to vote online. It’s the height of foolishness. If a voter can’t go to the poll
    booth once in a blue moon, they should be stripped of their voting privileges,
    not the felons, because that laziness is the real crime.\n\nLikewise, it is my
    hope that in the years to come the United States will realize the integrity of
    the ballot is the very cornerstone of our democracy and enact laws that make voting
    uniform from state to state and insist that every ballot, if necessary, can and
    will be counted by hand. As an editor of a newspaper we helped force two hand
    recounts of a controversial local city council election. I have been to the White
    House, won numerous awards, interviewed famous people and leaders, yet that recount
    remains the crowning moment of my career.\n\nVote.\n\nIt’s as simple as that."

  title: Ferguson’s ‘wary’ new normal is, sadly, the norm
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Ferguson is not alone. Oakland remembers well Fruitvale
    station. Videos pouring out of New York show a man being choked to death. Under
    the radar a vast coalition of victims and their families suffering at the hands
    of violent police suggest such things happen far more often than we like to admit.\n\nPerhaps
    you’ve simply been too weary to tune in. Perhaps you’ve allowed yourself to stay
    distant… Missouri may feel so far away. So remote.\n\nPerhaps you’d be willing
    to give a few minutes to re-engage, because as the people of Ferguson, Mo., seek
    to find their new normal, the issue remains dotted across the American landscape
    in places like Florida, Oakland, New York, and everywhere in between. Read on:\n>
    Nearly a month has passed since Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, was fatally
    shot by a police officer, Darren Wilson, in Ferguson, Mo. The confrontation sparked
    a string of protests that lasted for more than a week. A small stretch of West
    Florissant Avenue, where businesses were looted and nightly protests would sometimes
    crescendo into violent clashes, became the backdrop for a national debate about
    racism and the militarization of police forces.\n> \n> The commercial strip is
    returning to some semblance of normal, but the scars of the unrest and looting
    are still visible. Plywood covers many of the storefront windows. Some have messages
    calling for peace; others have “black owned” scrawled in paint or black marker.
    Tension is still in the air. There is still an occasional quiet march. Business
    owners are not ready to take down the plywood yet, they said. They are waiting
    to find out if charges will be filed against Officer Wilson, and bracing for more
    potential unrest.\n> \nvia [[Wary ‘Normal’ in Ferguson, Mo. – NYTimes.com](hthttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/us/ferguson-photos-after-the-protests.html?_r=0)](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/us/ferguson-photos-after-the-protests.html?_r=0).\n\nConsider
    the human impact on a community, and all those around it. This comes from a resident
    of Ferguson who struggled to live his busy life with a heart hurting for his neighbors
    and wariness over the sudden global spotlight on the place he calls home:\n> I
    live in a quiet, integrated, well-maintained, blue-collarish part of Ferguson.
    My neighborhood is about 2.5 miles away from where the young man was gunned down.
    I’d been working crazy hours during this period, often getting home around midnight.
    I know this sounds lame, but frankly I was too tired to join the nightly protests.
    I could occasionally hear distant sounds of gunfire/tear gas cannons, but chose
    to stay informed via local TV, Huff Post, Vice.com & Twitter. That said, I emphatically
    support those engaged in peaceful civil protest and empathize with their collective
    anger towards the ethnic profiling and double-standard treatment of African-Americans
    routinely practiced by local law enforcement.\n> \n> In my view, Ferguson has
    essentially three types of residential areas: a small Upper Middle Class area
    populated mostly by whites, fairly large integrated neighborhoods, and a large
    section of town mostly inhabited by lower middle class to poor African-American
    families. While in the past 10 years or so, Ferguson’s downtown area has seen
    a fair amount of gentrification (micro-brewery, wine bar, lofts, bakery, ice cream
    shop, bike shop, brand-new firehouse & police station, a farmer’s market, Victorian-style
    traffic & street lights, etc.), the African-American part of town has not enjoyed
    a similar resurgence. Taking into consideration some objectionable Ferguson/St.
    Louis Co. police tactics currently in practice; plus, the fact that almost all
    of the new downtown businesses are white-owned and the ethnic make-up of Ferguson’s
    city government and law enforcement officials doesn’t remotely mirror the town’s
    racial demographics, this was/is a community with institutionalized social and
    economic problems simmering just below the surface.\n> \n> Many of us fear if
    the officer involved in the shooting isn’t at the very least indicted, things
    could get really ugly here again.\n\nThis could well be describing many cities
    across the country.\n\nFerguson will only stand for more than a terrible shooting
    and violent protests if it becomes the symbol for solutions, a place where a simmering
    cauldron of anger turned to a compassionate movement of honoring human life. The
    problems stem beyond one police officer and the need for more people hurt and/or
    imprisoned. Ferguson, like so many other cities, need a government, business climate
    and police force that reflects the entire community and is focused on new solutions
    beyond mass incarceration and racial profiling.\n\nMore importantly, police need
    to lead the charge. They can no longer say these are “isolated incidents.” The
    majority of police are honorable, courageous and under-appreciated leaders of
    local communities. They are the first interaction with every segment of life.
    And they have to join the effort of reform, the effort to decarcerate and rehabilitate
    rather than escalate. Can we humanize rather than militarize our police? Can police
    stand in front of the call for prison reform? They best know the populations who
    need the most help. Can we take off the tear gas masks and look each other in
    the eye to see our commonness again?\n\nCan we now, finally, reach across the
    riot lines in search of peace?"

  title: Unleash the power of Positive Thought Arming
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    During some pretty damn dark days I discovered a glimmer of twinkling light in a simple exercise called Positive Thought Arming. Now as my life continues its massive restoration project, I find its more important than ever to return to this powerful tool to protect me from myself.

    The technique comes from Cognitive Behavorial Therapy techniques that alter thinking as a first-line of defense against destructive behavior.

    In the simplest terms, Positive Thought Arming is a u-turn on a long solitary road headed in the wrong direction. It turns us back to a place where life can work again, where gratitude outshines the worries and troubles that are inevitable passengers. Because at times we are our own worst enemies. We revert to old ways of thinking or fall into despair and undercut all that we are trying to accomplish. We grow weary.

    Weariness and discouragement are inevitable. That’s precisely the time to re-arm with positive thoughts. PTA is far more than just trying to be a positive person. I’m talking about weapons, prepared and practiced for just the right time when hope is fading fast.

    It’s easy to lose an attitude of gratitude. The more I work with re-entering citizens, the more I see how life erodes the foundation of gratitude and simplicity that they often possess when they walk out Criminal U.  They get worn to nub. The positive energy they once relied on to survive a place like prison disappears. I see this diminished inner strength fade right before my eyes. I’ve see it fade within me as well.

    I’ve come to realize that what we do in life is often determined by the lens from which we choose to view it. If we focus our energies on all that is wrong, we miss the simple blessings of all that is better. We focus so much on the results we lose the pleasure in the journey. If we instead view life through a lens of gratitude, we find undiscovered reserves of patience, strength and determination that are essential in overcoming the long odds of staying out of prison and having a productive meaningful life.

    That lens is critical. Choosing the right one each and every day is often the most important thing I do.

    December sucked. In the midst of a lot of good things happening and a lot of potential for even better things, all things suddenly crashed to a halt. I felt besieged. Soon I couldn’t see the very same blessing that once flooded my brain each morning as soon as my feet hit the floor. The blessings were still there, but my focus had shifted. I took a turn somewhere, headed down an emotional road that was in the opposite direction of where my life is headed.

    As the calendar turned and fireworks announced the new beginning in the cold night sky, I knew I was supposed to feel renewed optimism. A new year. December was done. Good things were bound to happen, right? Right??!

    But life doesn’t acknowledge our calendar. Jan. 1 felt very much like Dec. 31, and the same troubles, pettiness, frustrations, impatience and worries greeted me when I woke up. I knew I needed to change the lens from which I viewed my life. That’s about the time I discovered a handful of index cards I wrote years ago back in prison at a time when I felt alone and worried, a time when I had to confront my alcoholism and failures and loss of freedom and hopelessness all at once. It was a time I learned about Positive Thought Arming.

    On those pink cards were 31 sayings that I wrote down. Thirty-one short, powerful, meaningful thoughts that helped shift my focus up onto the horizon and away from the messy bog of despair at my feet.

    I took to saying them often. I memorized them. In a rehab program I was in at the time, I gave a presentation about what my 31 bullets of positive thoughts meant to me. My voice cracked in the opening sentence as I mentioned the first one: “And they lived happily ever after.” I could barely finish the presentation as I recalled the great love I shared with my wife that had endured despite all the loss I heaped upon us. Grief and gratitude pinched at my eyes and clenched my throat in front of a room of hardened men. The thought’s power hugged me: nothing so bad could ever beat me when I’d already won the lottery in my soulmate. From our first days together we would say to each other, “and they lived happily ever after.”

    We knew it was true then. We knew it was true even when our world was shattered by my failures. We know it now despite the hard road to recovery and wholeness we’ve been on. We are confident we will know it still one day when we breathe our last on this side of heaven.

    It’s hard to be sour when you focus on such things. It’s hard not see the day differently. And that’s the power of Positive Thought Arming. You arm yourself with these punches of positivity that strike deep within you and shove away all the shit that tries to drag you down. We fight back the negativity of this world with positive thoughts that start a change reaction of positive actions that build positive beliefs and eventually connect us to the positive future we envision for ourselves.

    A little thought truly can change our world, which is very, very good to remember when times get tough.

  title: 'Legend’s #FreeAmerica innovates toward reform'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Modern philanthropy is a lot like the innovation economy: It’s hands-on, driven for impact and ambitious. Modern donors want to be involved. They want to pour their money and influence into seemingly intractable social problems and move them forcibly toward change. The new #FreeAmerica platform fits this perfectly.

    By that and any other definition, John Legend is a modern philanthropist. He announced his #FreeAmerica campaign shortly after his Oscar victory with Hip Hop’s Common for their song, “Glory.”

    “#FREEAMERICA is a multi-year culture campaign initiated by John Legend to change the national conversation about our country’s misguided policies and transform America’s criminal justice system,” the [website](http://letsfreeamerica.com) states.
    Today #FreeAmerica is taking the message of prison reform to a global platform. Legend announced he’d tour and learn and better understand the plague of mass incarceration. He’s followed through. Soon, he is likely to take innovative steps toward reform. He will likely be hands-on, innovative and focused on meaningful impact.

    That is exactly what is needed, and what someone with his platform can do better than most. #FreeAmerica could likely end up doing just that.

    To date, talk about prison reform is rampant. Yet so much of it is talk. Sentencing reform is a hot-button political issue. It’s critically important from a moral standpoint. But it won’t reform a broken system that will send people back into society ill-prepared to make their way. The revolving door of incarceration will continue.

    New York Times Columnist David Brooks made this point painfully clear in a recent column [when he wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/opinion/david-brooks-the-prison-problem.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss), “The popular explanation for how we got here, however, seems largely to be wrong, and most of the policy responses flowing from it may therefore be inappropriate.”

    Brooks points out that reform can’t happen without the participation of district attorneys and prosecutors who have nearly unfettered power to overcharge with felonies. Data backs him up. Far more arrests result in felony charges that lead to plea deals with prison time attached. Felonies stick for life. This process has little oversight.

    This is just one area of badly needed reform. As the corruption in Brooklyn has shown with dozens of bad arrests, prosecution of police and prosecutors who knowingly charge the wrong people is also badly needed. A deeper understanding of supervision after prison and better oversight of this is badly needed. A whole gang of issues are badly needed.

    The system needs an overhaul. None of the political leaders talking about prison reform to date starting with every presidential candidate in 2016 has come close to articulating a true vision of reform, one that gets the job done right.

    In short, the issue of prison reform is one of those seemingly “unsolvable” problems that won’t be solved without the power of philanthropic innovation.  Legend could well be the person to best champion a real platform of reform, not one driven by political will or gain, but one steeped in the possibility of what can be done in a thoroughly modern way.

  title: Restorative Justice? It actually works
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Have you ever noticed how justice is so often paired with mercy in the Bible? Anyone who has felt the sting of justice and/or pled for much needed mercy likely has. But the second word is often lost in the conversation, where justice has become synonymous with revenge. Justice in political speak means “tough on crime,” which wins votes while bankrupting state coffers that pay for human warehousing and little else.

    But many organizations around the country still think of both justice and mercy. That translates to a phrase called “restorative justice.” It’s been around a long time, but few take it seriously. Those that do can tell you all about the incredible successes. For example, a quiet little organization called the [Victim/Offender Reconciliation Program](http://www.vorp.com/) has done admirable work at restoring the damages from criminal behavior by treating people as human beings, flawed human beings to be sure, but still human beings. You’ll hear more about their work in the weeks to come on this site.

    Today we spotlight California’s [Insight Prison Project](http://www.insightprisonproject.org/). The mission in simple: they work to break the cycle of crime by developing “behavior inspired by insight, accountability and compassion.” Recently, the group used grant money to expand programs to women, who represent one of the fastest growing populations in prison.

    Take a moment to check out the exciting work of restorative justice this group is doing by simply combining justice and mercy, exactly as intended for the best results in truly breaking the cycle of addiction and crime. They’d love a donation, which can be easily made on their website.

  title: Public’s prison fascination could propel reform
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Inside Criminal U, counselors, guards, treatment providers and officials are quick to remind you that the public simply doesn’t care about you when you cross through behind the bars and barbed wires.

    They aren’t lying.

    But, it’s a narrow view, one that excludes the obvious public prison fascination that make Alcatraz one of the most popular tourist sites in a city filled with them, Orange is the New Black one of the hottest new shows and things from prison — be it poetry, art, tattoos, clothes, [spreads](http://www.amazon.com/Prison-Spreads-101-culture-recipes-ebook/dp/B00GS7QH06/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1388773371&sr=8-11&keywords=bolsinger), or stories — in high demand.

    I was reminded of this a few weeks ago when my son sent me photos of Alcatraz. It’s packed with people having the time of their lives visiting a terrible prison.

    I recalled the last time I went there, just a few months before my sentencing hearing, while I was out on bail. I stared into those tiny cells and simply couldn’t imagine living in one. I didn’t have to imagine it long. Soon I was in a carbon copy, a state penitentiary that was built the same time as Alcatraz with the same basic floor-plan. The main difference is most of the cells that held one prisoner on Alcatraz, now held two at the state pen.

    These tours are important, I realize now, not just fun. They tell the history of incarceration, one that has a most current chapter of massive build-up, massive profits and terrible human destruction.

    Shows that sensationalize prisons help in their own way to direct focus to the real stories and issues behind them. All of it points to the big business that is prison. Consider the profits people are finding in [prison consulting](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/fashion/prison-consulting-draws-new-crop-of-ex-cons.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), according to the *New York Times*. *USA Today* reported on dozens of websites and any number of ways people on the outside try to profit for the public’s prison fascination.

    The public’s fascination will help bring an end to public indifference. The Tipping Point will change that. Soon many, many more prisons will be shuttered like Alcatraz. I hope they all become museums, to tell the story of a society that for a time, stopped caring about human beings in most need of reform.

  title: Filmmaker takes hard look at life after prison
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |
    Filmmaker Levon Hinton latest documentary focuses on the long-standing truth about America’s failed War on Drugs and the ensuing epidemic of mass incarceration called *Victims of Misfortune: Changing the Pecking Order*. The unique focus of this film centers on the obstacles to re-entry inmates face in life after prison.

    He’s written, produced, directed and contributed content to several dozen short films, original web series, television shows, music videos and documentaries. This may be his most courageous project yet, and it's one you can get involved in right now through his [crowdsource fundraising campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/victims-of-misfortune-documentary-film).

    All crowdsource campaigns need that initial burst of support to rise and thrive. A number of small donations from Criminal U readers would help ensure this important project gets made.

    We had the privilege of asking Hinton more about his project.

    __CriminalU: How did you come to focus on this story at this time? What’s your interest in criminal justice reform?__
    Levon Hinton: I’ve always studied America’s public policies. I started listening to the dialogue being projected in regards to the prison system and I noticed that there was a lot of misinformation being regurgitated. Nobody was talking solutions for the people who are victims of America’s public policies. I’ve read a lot of books by scholars and seen plenty of documentaries by various filmmakers but what I didn’t see/read was any solutions for those people affected by America’s failed policies. My interest is in helping people who were systematically lowered to a second class citizenship by providing solutions.

    __CU: Your campaign photo shows you in full dress marine uniform. Tell us about your military career?__
    LH: After I graduated high school I went to college for a semester and I realized that I needed money to go to college. Since my oldest sister was already in school, money was tight, So I dropped out of college and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps to help pay my tuition. I graduated as a Squad Leader from boot-camp in Parris Island SC. I was one of the top soldiers in my platoon.

    __CU: Your documentary talks about the war on American citizens through incarceration and drugs. Did this similarity from your own experience shape your interest and approach to this documentary? If so, explain a bit.__
    LH: We discuss racism, incarceration and drugs. So my experiences growing up in the South dealing with some of these current issues shaped my interest. We took a very bold approach when working on the concept of this documentary. We wanted to provide an educational documentary without favoritism to any political party and show this system in its proper historical context.

    __CU: Spike Lee recently used a crowdsource campaign to fund his film, so maybe you can meet your goals the same way. Despite the recent attention to reform after decades of mass incarceration and public indifference, it is still a very tough sale to get people interested. What do you say to people when they ask why should they give?__
    LH: Crowdsourcing is a good avenue for filmmakers like myself if we’re able to reach our goal. When people ask me why should they give there are many reasons that come to mind but I’ll keep it short. This issue is affecting all of America, with at least 60+ million people with a felony record unable to gain employment, denied housing and education. Yet we want these people to pay for their crimes. Then post conviction make it so that they’re unable provide for or defend their families. It is inhumane and makes absolutely no sense. Every year billions of tax dollars go to the prison industrial complex and corporations are raking in hundreds of millions of dollars off of cheap labor. Law abiding Americans are losing their jobs and the same corporations that’s using prison labor led the nation in lay offs. So your money is being spent to create these problems why not have your money go to creating solutions.

    __CU: Anything else critically important that I didn’t ask you about?__
    LH: I want people to keep in mind this is not a documentary about people not paying if they commit crimes but rather how we treat them once they’ve paid for their crimes. I would like everyone to contribute to this documentary and help us make this film. We’re invested a lot of money, time and resources and now we need the public’s help if America is to ever move forward.

  title: 'Taking care of ‘family’: Loyalty on the outside'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    You see it every day inside the barbed wire and walls of American prisons. An inmate packs his or her things after a night of mini-celebrations and anxious waiting. Good-byes are said to those staying inside. The person headed out makes a passionate promise: “I’ll get at you brother. I’ll be in touch.”

    Most mean it. Few do it.

    No sooner than free air fill the lungs of the newly departed, good intention of reaching back inside to help evaporates like mist. Good intentions don’t put money on the phone or pen to paper in a letter or more importantly to do something the person left inside can’t do for themselves.

    It’s why Eric Barden is truly heroic. Not only did he promise Antonio Yarbough to help, but he kept the promise, just as he would any member of his family. It required a lot of time, persistence and faith. Not only did he follow through, he went far beyond the extra mile to ensure his friend from inside, who faced 75-years-to life, someday joined him outside.

    “I wasn’t going to leave him in there, man. You must be crazy,” he says. “Not nobody you ate with for five years. You break bread with and you can’t leave that.  I got home, first and foremost, and tried to take care of myself and make sure my mom’s OK. But at the same time you don’t forget the people you were loyal with in jail. We’re like a family. You understand one thing only and that is you will do everything for that person.”

    When few had hope for Yarbough, Barden did. When few believed his innocence, Barden did. More importantly he put that hope and belief into action.

    Yarbough is a free man today, exonerated of the murder of his mother and little sister that he did not commit, in large part because Barden got out and went to work on his behalf.

    “I can’t believe it myself,” Barden says of his role in the nearly six-year effort to free Yarbough. “I knew something was funny. I knew, I knew. You know when you get a gut feeling and I knew I had to do something. Because that’s my boy.”

    Barden started by searching Google for “pro bono attorney.” Barden spent more than 16 years in prison from the time he was 22. He didn’t know how to use a computer much less own one. He borrowed his brother’s and got to work.

    He found [Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma](http://zmolaw.com/attorney-profiles/free-tony-yarbough/), a successful Manhattan-based defense attorney who actually takes serious his ethical responsibility to offer pro bono services.

    Margulis-Ohnuma invited Barden to his office. Barden made the long trek from outer Queens in a suit and tie and told the attorney about his friend left behind. Margulis-Ohnuma took the case.

    “That’s what amazing to me is that he followed up, and even family members of Zachary followed up,” Barden said.

    It was amazing because at first it seemed the only way to correct the possible miscarriage of justice was to solve the crime itself. Margulis-Ohnuma sensed the case was a bad conviction based entirely on a forced confession and brow-beating a 15-year-old kid named Shariff Wilson to point the finger at his friend Yarbough even though both were gone when the crimes were committed.

    Margulis-Ohnuma connected the case to a Brooklyn-based attorney, Phillip Smallman, who had already gotten one man exonerated and knew the tainted record of the district attorney’s office at that time. Smallman agreed to come aboard representing Wilson.

    The break in the case came when DNA found at the scene was tested. The test revealed that DNA was also found at another murder nine years later when Yarbough was already locked up. Still the case dragged on.

    “I stayed in contact with Zachary and he let me know what was happening. Every court date I had to be there,” Barden says.

    Back inside, Yarbough began to experience hope. Margulis-Ohnuma’s sister came to visit. She put him contact with us at Criminal U. Soon Yarbough was getting letters, small gifts, a care package– things that reminded him he was not alone.

    Then on February 7, 2014, Yarbough was exonerated along with Wilson. Just 48 hours after being an inmate and a number he was the guest of Piers Morgan on CNN. One week later he celebrated his 40th birthday, the first he celebrated outside of prison since he turned 18.

    “I’m proud of both of them lawyers,” Barden said.

    Barden and his family provided Yarbough a place to live. The two friends have been supporting one another, encouraging one another and adapting together to life on the outside. Both are defying the long odds by staying out of prison, a battle that began for Barden six years ago and continues.

    “I think the major thing that helped me out is coming home to a family, my brother and my mother.  A house in Queens and the environment is nice, not where I grew up in Brooklyn,” Barden said.

    Barden grew up in the infamous Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, known mostly during Barden’s youth for its crack sales and violence. His family’s move to Queens helped him avoid trouble when he got out. He passed all he learned to Yarbough when he got out.

    Both have had troubled finding permanent work, even though Yarbough has no criminal record. Barden also remains on parole and under supervision, which puts restrictions on his ability to kick-start his life. He still is looking for permanent work in maintenance, something he enjoys doing.

    “It’s hard for people of color with records to get a job. It’s about who you know. You can’t get a job with parole,” he says.

    Still he’s not discouraged. He will finish parole no later than January 2017. He and Yarbough want to work together to help young men avoid the prison system. He is confident it will all fall in place because he already defied the long odds by not going back to prison.

    “The best thing I pat myself on the back about is I’m not doing nothing bad. I’m trying to stay free,” he says.

    But the even longer odds he defied is what truly shows the man’s character. He didn’t forget the “family” he left behind. Keeping his word he gave the day he left Attica was the one thing he was absolutely sure he was going to do when he got out.

    “The best thing I’m going to live for is the loyalty to people,” he says. “But the things that are wrong with system, I’m going to work against it. I’m going to make difference.”

    He already has in a significant way.

  title: 'Rule #16: Surf the creative energy'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I’ve always loved surfing. I love the grittiness, the salt, the power of the ocean, its relentlessness. But I can’t surf. I’ve tried often, but having left the beach at 17 when I headed off to college, my attempts to surf were sporadic, not to mention ridiculously repetitive. Practice on the sand. Feel awkward. Paddle out. Feel even more awkward as the board slips around and out from under me until I try to tame it like a wild horse. Wave coming. Flip over. Tumble. Paddle again. Really, really awkward. Turtle under a wave. Crest another. Reach the calm. Whew. Exhausted, insecure but slightly pleased. Until it dawns on me. I haven’t ridden a wave yet. Paddle, paddle, paddle furiously….miss the wave, slide back. “Son of a bitch!” Look ahead. Fellow surfers riding waves. Having time of their lives. Deep breath. Paddle, paddle, paddle like your life depends on it…and suddenly a great power propels you forward and its…heaven. Magical. But you can’t wait. Pop up! Too soon… You stand and it looks like a cliff into nothingness ahead of you, which you realize you are falling head long into…CRASH, TUMBLE, EYES STING FROM SALT, SAND GRINDS INTO SKIN, LUNGS GASP FOR AIR UNTIL like Jonah you are spewed up onto the beach, your board slapping behind you like a dog on a leash, looking at you expectantly like, “What are you doing sitting down. Come on! Let’s go do it again! Can we? Can we?!”

    … gasping breath, soggy head, burned skin… you say to yourself, “That was so scary…It was … (pant, pant) AWESOME!”

    You try again and again. You feel the Chi in your board shorts. You know you’re close. The aha moment is coming, if only I can get back out there one more time. Fatigue has set in though. You need a break. You sit on the beach on watch the seemingly effortless flow of surfers hilariously riding waves with the panache of a painter at a canvas. Soon, you think.

    But the vacation is over. Months pass. Snow falls. You snowboard and feel the thrill. But in the back of your mind you think, God I wish I could surf too.

    When you finally make it back it’s like starting all over again, which it is because you’ve not tried for months and months. You grow older. You get fatter. It seems more and more impossible, perhaps an opportunity forever lost. Maybe it’s just not in my DNA, you think. You have only wishful thinking and a crystal clear memory of that glorious second or two standing on the precipice of the abyss and (in your mind) riding the power of the universe like a bat out of hell. Those were a great two seconds, you think lingering with the odd mixture of contentedness and longing.

    Yes, I love surfing even though I can’t do it Even now, I’m pulled. Summer is coming soon and this year… Goddamnit ALL I will truly surf, I vow.

    My spiritual life is pretty close to my efforts to surf. It’s the closest experience I’ve ever had figuring what a spiritual journey is like. It captures those moments of ecstasy riding the power that fuels the universe. It vividly models the relentlessness needed to maintain the journey.

    The ocean is like the lion, the king of the jungle of God’s creative world. Riding it is to ride within the flow of God’s power. Learning the effortlessness needed to ride it well is the key to the spiritual journey.

    Ultimately, I am convinced the Bible and nature and our experience speak to this creative force in the world — this thing we call God that can be pictured as a giant wave — flowing in contrast to the destructive rip tides of hate in the world.

    So as we hit Rule 16, I simply advise that no matter how many times you crash out into the sand, keep paddling. Surf the creative energy in this world to find what its like to truly live.

    So how do we ride the wave? Well, I think Jesus was the best surfer this planet has ever known, better than other serious shredders like Buddha and maybe Ghandi and Lao Tse. (*don’t get all haywire here… this is one of the pleasant debates, like who’s better Willie Mays or Babe Ruth. It is not one of those crazy debates where we all grab our various scriptures and beat each other to death with them, OK? Play nice.*) So let’s ask Jesus how to ride the wave.

    Jesus and Nicodemus, a Jewish religious leader, meet up. Rather than debate, Nicodemus seems genuinely interested, puzzled, sincere. Perhaps not. Perhaps he’s simply trying to trap Jesus or debate him, but we get no mention of it. We can only infer sincerity from the reading, because he only asks questions. And because Jesus offers sincere answers, I suspect Jesus is taking him seriously as well. Nicodemus wants to ride the same waves. He genuinely is trying to better understand God and learn whether Jesus is who they say he is, if his miracles are genuine, if indeed he is of God.

    So, he says, “You must be a teacher because your miracles are of God.”

    This is a key starting point. By the actions of Jesus alone, Nicodemus accepts he must be from God. In other words, he says the creative energy coming from Jesus looks, feels and produces what we in our limited understanding of such things can see as *divine*.

    At the core of my belief I feel there are two energies in this world. First, a creative energy that sells to build, repair, heal, bless and bring beauty. It is love. Love cannot produce terrible things, no more than a sugar cane can produce salt. A thing evolves from its roots, from its core DNA. Love produces that which brings forth creative, sustainable energy, because the source of love is God herself. The result of his work, when God’s artistic talents are released in the world, is art, beauty, kindness, restoration, growth.

    The second force is fueled by hate. It is at the root evil. This is rebellion against God. It can not be created by God. It is the result perhaps of God allowing humans choice. I don’t believe animals or plants or even sharks are evil. They are instinctual, living as part of the complex ecosystem of life. Same for hurricanes and tornadoes. But humans, and apparently angels as well, God allowed choice – free will. It is the only way we could love him. That choice allows evil to take root. The fruit of evil or hate is evident: destruction, death, violence, greed and lost.

    This to me is the simplest way to see the hand of God. Where there is hate, it grows from the root of a destructive energy. Where there is love, it grows from the root of creative energy. One God opposes. The other she nurtures.

    The mystery is why God allows it to continue. But God is the mystery. Her plan for this world is known to her alone. Any attempts to solve that are in fact trying to diminish God, to become God ourselves. It’s ultimately destructive, but I suspect a necessary part of the journey, like the many nasty crashes I’ve had trying to surf. It may even be how we learn to need faith. By faith we live the mystery.

    So Nicodemus, a religious leader, affirms all I just said by saying in effect, “the source of your miracles are creative and healing, therefore from God.” But Jesus confounds him because he needs to know his desire to “explain God” is destined to fail. Jesus says these miracles are nothing, “You must be born again.”

    If we stop there, the evangelicals win the day and we all have to start repeating the four spiritual laws as ordered.

    But, Jesus doesn’t stop there at all. He has more to explain: “that which is born of the flesh is flesh, that born of the spirit is spirit.”

    He’s explaining the energies. It seems he could just as easily say, that which grows from sugar is sweet, but that which grows from bitterness is bitter, or that which grows from love is creative, from hate is destructive.

    Jesus understands he confounds us. He sees Nicodemus’ confusion. He basically says next, “it is a mystery” far more difficult to confine to four laws or rigid rules or white-knuckled obedience.

    When I read this I think of surfing. No matter how many times someone has tried to “teach” me to surf, there really isn’t much they can say. “Do less… now jump up, no less, well a bit more than that…” as Paul Rudd tried to explain in the movie *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*.

    It can’t be taught, really. And all throughout scripture God is telling us like he told Moses in Exodus 14, “do less.” Stand back. See me.

    Well, God actually said, “The Lord will fight for you. You need only be still.”

    Remember now, this is the most pivotal moment in Moses life, when the world’s greatest super power is hunting him down ready to create a genocide. Be still, he says.

    Jesus continues the thread saying if you can’t believe Earthly things (like healings or water-to-wine miracles and such) how will you believe heavenly things (which requires faith!)?

    So here’s the crux, about mid-way through this ancient conversation, right in the center of it. And what have we done? We pluck it out and bandy it carelessly about.

    Perhaps your first memory verse, like mine was John 3:16. Read it. “For God so loved the world…” All the focus is always on the second part: “That he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.”

    This is foundation of evangelicalism, this verse. Believe in Jesus. Be born again (by saying a prayer asking to be born again) and you’ll have everlasting life! Heaven insurance just like that. It’s all there in John 3, and similar ideas are found in Romans (the old Roman Road) by picking out similar verses.

    But the emphasis of the whole story is on the source of all things, not the formula for Salvation. The verse starts with, “for God so loved the world.”

    Love, the creative energy – flowing to the world, to push back evil, to reclaim broken people, to heal the wounds of our life here on earth — is the source, the way to true life, here “on Earth as it is in heaven,” as Jesus himself prayed.

    It’s a wave, not an insurance policy and our surfboards are made of faith, such that if we set our minds to spiritual things, if we allow ourselves by the Spirit to be renewed by faith (not in a single prayer but over a lifetime spiritual journey, daily, over and over again, growing, being healed, creatively producing love and beauty in our own way) we too can be redeemed. Because the point of it all is right after that big centerpiece verse of John 3:16, in the often neglected John 3:17: “For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn (negative energy, destruction, hate) the world, but that through him we might be saved (the creative energy of God, her work of art, the Earth restored to its Garden of Eden beauty, where evil and hate are dispelled).

    By the harvest our lives produce, we can know if we are part of the creative energy or the destructive energy. “Wrought by God” the scriptures say, which is like autographed by God. Our words are meaningless. The Kingdom of heaven isn’t a frat we get into by hazing and vows of loyalty. It’s by sensing who we are and having actions of grace flow from us that reveals our source. Do we produce or destroy? Love or hate? Build it up or tear it down? Spread kindness or dissension? All that comes from the light are true, signed by God. All in darkness are lies, destructive, evil.

    Again, it’s a mystery Jesus knows our limits in knowing heavenly things. But he tells Nicodemus how to see what comes from God, what has been reclaimed by God, what he has Born Again (not us..).

    One prayer isn’t a magical key to God’s kingdom. A journey of creative, positive, healing energy reveals our true heart. Our lives tell the story if we’ve been born again. Later in John 14, Jesus tells us how to find God. Follow the way. How? through truth. Seek the truth and you will find life, i.e., live in a moment of continual rebirth — born again, in the continual present.

    The point is Evangelicals (disclaimer, I’m painting with a bad broom. Much of my spiritual journey has Godly evangelicals as the safe houses along my underground railroad journey. I love them to death, was once among them and lovingly ask them to stay on the journey of truth rather than guard a static dogma) often make the circle of God’s redemption smaller and smaller by limiting it only to those who say the right words. God seems to make it bigger and bigger, such that he wants to save “the world” (V.16-17). He wants to recreate his greatest work of art, the world, through love.

    I’d guess there is no mention of what Nicodemus did because Jesus never asks him to do anything. No altar call. No prayer.  He leaves Nicodemus to continue his spiritual journey, because he knows the religious leader is seeking truth. He’ll find it. Perhaps he already has. His pursuits of truth, led him to Jesus, led him to ask great questions. He is already seeking. His journey doesn’t start or end with John 3. It continues throughout a lifetime.

    I could be wrong. But 25 years of trying to ride spiritual waves, thankfully with more success than trying to surf convinces me I’m right enough. You can’t go wrong in the journey.

    I’m going to ride those waves right up to the shore, no matter how many times they grind me into the beach and my son, I encourage you to grab a board and join me.

  title: What’s a JLWOP? A continuing crime against humanity
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    As energy for token prison reform grows, kids are getting long overdue attention. Reform for kids is always easier, even kids who commit the most serious of crimes. Unfortunately, for all the talk about reform, the only action being taken so far is making the harsh reality even worse.

    Recent news about juveniles in the prison system is particularly grim. An article by Salon shed light into the [darkest realities of kids in prison](http://www.salon.com/2015/07/02/new_report_lays_bare_the_horrific_reality_of_youths_detained_in_adult_prisons/), which any inmates to some extent has seen.

    More kids are in solitary. More kids are locked up with adults. And thousands remain sentenced to life without parole despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that calls such sentences unconstitutional. It’s called JWLOP and it’s a travesty of the school-to-prison pipeline.

    In [Miller v. Alabama](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-9646g2i8.pdf) (June 25, 2012)  the Supreme Court deemed mandatory Juvenile Life without Parole sentencing violates the eighth amendment and is cruel and unusual punishment.

    However, most states still have latitude to enact a life sentence if they still chose. The court declined to hear two cases that would have clarified what changes should be made and if past sentences should be revised. It remains very much in a state of flux and varies widely state by state.

    For example, Illinois is now considering the retroactivity of this ruling that could affect 80 inmates “who were sentenced based on a law now deemed unconstitutional,” according to news reports.

    Also, four dozen Colorado JWLOP inmates got their hopes “crushed this month when the Colorado Supreme Court decided, in a series of related challenges to LWOP sentences, that the illegal sentences could simply be tweaked, in many instances, into forty-year-to-life sentences — and that life without parole can still be imposed on juveniles convicted of first-degree murder as long as it’s not automatic in all cases,” wrote Alan Prendegast.

    Prendegast noted that Boulder District Attorney Stan Garnett broke “with many of his fellow prosecutors to denounce the rulings as ’embarrassing’ and a ‘a big disappointment.'”

    A recent New York Times story explained how little has changed in many states for juveniles sentenced to life without parole prior to Miller v. Alabama.  The article shows how many states have chosen not to apply the case to past convictions and/or do not plan to change the status quo until forced to do so by further legal rulings.

    It’s a collective mess and a disgrace for how our prison system is incapable of dealing with children caught in the clutches of crime.

    There is good news. The Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth has released the first-ever [trial defense guidelines](http://fairsentencingofyouth.org/defense-guidelines/) for children facing life sentences, according to the Juvenile Law Center website. The more standards are adopted, the more states might consider the application of these guidelines retroactively.

    It’s safe to say the courts are finished with this and what changes that take place will take time. Many organizations work on this issue to some extent, but here are a couple of starting places for resources and help.

  title: 'Rule #9: Tend your garden'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Wouldn’t you know it? I spent roughly 20 years living in rural hamlets on the West Coast and the East Coast constantly at war with my inner rumblings that craved urban life. I then moved to San Francisco and as the song says “I left my heart” there. But only after becoming a true urbanite did I discover the pleasure, Chi and delight of planting and tending a garden. All those years wasted when I could have been growing food and cultivating skills of sustainability. It’s a shame.

    Now I love my urban life, but I make it a large priority to have my pots and grow what I can wherever I am, just to feel the dirt, see the birth of the seed, remove the weeds and watch the life-cycle of food of which we are so dependent grow before my eyes each summer.

    Only as I embraced the garden did I realize how the seasons mirror the ebb and flow of life. We are connected to this ecosystem. We flow with the flow of God’s creative energy from one season to the next — plant, nurture, grow, harvest, death, barrenness, rebirth.

    I urge you to think of this process allegorically, not literally (though the role of food is important and will merit its own rule down the line). I tend the garden literally because of what it teaches me about tending my garden figuratively.

    If your life is a patch of dirt, how does it look? Is it nurtured soil, well tilled, and planted to produce? Is it free of pests that could destroy the very thing you wish to grow? Or is it a weed-covered thistle patch, barren of all life-giving produce that yells an indictment of neglect? My hunch is not so extreme. Most lives resemble something in between.

    Gardens don’t grow much haphazardly. They take intentionality. It’s no wonder the Bible refers so often to farm and garden metaphors, literally called “husbandry” of the land. We must love the Earth as we’d love our bride.

    So I’ve gone a few times around the mulberry bush (Hmm..I better say blackberry bush because I have no idea what a mulberry bush looks like…) to get to the point of this rule. Your responsibility in life is to tend to your patch of dirt. That’s it.

    Tend your garden.

    Americans talk a big game about saving the world. We are the Super-Sized people. Massive consumers. Bigger is always better. We’d rather text $10 to save Haiti then use manners with our neighbors. We need to belong at the Mega Church (a phrase invented by the American obsession with super-sized life) yet have lives filled with troubled relationships under our own roof. Super Wal-Marts abound, while fruit and vegetable stands grow extinct.  We order free-trade coffee at the mega-chain Starbucks to support growers in a foreign land, while the locally owned café next door goes out of business, bags of free-trade coffee left unsold. We like to “do our part” to make the world a better place while we wouldn’t consider getting up early on a Saturday morning to cover graffiti on our own block.

    I did a Google search that exemplifies how important this rule can be. I typed in “garden” and row after row of perfectly manicured, [mansion-type landscapes](https://www.google.com/search?q=Garden&newwindow=1&safe=active&rlz=1C1OPRB_enUS567US567&espv=210&es_sm=122&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=AP_vUr3CCcyFogSg2IKIDA&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&biw=1534&bih=868&dpr=0.75#newwindow=1&q=Garden&safe=active&tbm=isch&imgdii=_) came up, as this is the American idea of a garden. I didn’t see a scrap of food anywhere on the screen. Super-sized Gardens even.

    Tending your garden recognizes a responsibility to those things you can touch, those people you can look in the eye and that face you see in the mirror. Is it really better to send $30 a month to a global organization so you have a refugee’s picture on your wall? What’s better, to send $10 to the American Red Cross effort to improve an orphanage in Zimbabwe, or to donate a pint of blood to local Red Cross who will use the blood for a patient in the hospital down the road? If you can do both, all the better. Haiti victims need our help as do orphans. Your generosity in those acts makes you more human and more empathic. But your responsibility, not just generosity, lies at home.

    If you become a healthy, generous source of creative energy where you live, work and play, you are indeed saving the world. If you remain open and malleable to God’s prompting in your own backyard – you’ll make a difference in a tangible, mutual, human way that will never impact you like super-sized attempts at altruism.

    Again, I refer to Spenser P.I., who in several books finds himself risking his life to help out one prostitute whose ease he has become involved in. When asked why, he is clear. He can’t stop all women from being victims of the sex trade, but he can help this one girl who came into his life make her own choice about hers. If it’s worth doing, its worth doing well, he reasons.

    We aren’t Superman. We shouldn’t super-size much of anything, I think. Super-sized meals are killing us just as they are killing the local church or the local business or the local economy. We are just gardeners, with a small patch of dirt hopefully well cared for.

    But I shouldn’t say “just” and minimize tending your garden. It may be small and at times irrelevant, but I think within that dirt lies the gold of our true lives.

  title: Inspired to turn lens of truth onto prison industry
  author: Dave Moutray
  contentAboveNewsletter: |
    For a country that prides itself in freedom and was founded on the promise of it, it’s tragically ironic that the U.S. incarcerates its citizens at the highest rate of any other country in the world. While the U.S. only represents 4.4 percent of the world’s population, somehow it houses 22 percent of the world’s prisoners. Business is booming in America if you’re in the prison industry.

    How is this possible? How did the “land of the free” end up building so many prisons, so much so that it’s become a billion-dollar industry? Those questions, and many more, are fueling my drive to do a documentary through a partnership with CriminalU and Effin Artist this coming year. Well, if I’m honest, it’s more than just the questions at this point. The more I research, the more I dig, the more I know it’s the answers–the answers to how we got to this point and how we can get ourselves out of this business of incarceration that costs taxpayers 80 billion a year–that motivate me.

    While some movement toward reform has happened since Obama made it one of his priorities, we’re not close to the real reform that needs to happen. Shane Bauer, a columnist for Mother Jones, writes that “ultimately, the only way to bring our prison population anywhere near pre-Reagan era levels—when we had about 300,000 people behind bars—would be to make major changes in sentencing for more serious crimes.

    “Nationally, 47 percent of prisoners are incarcerated for violent crimes and 18 percent for property offenses. If we let out everyone incarcerated for a drug offense, our total prison population would drop from 1.6 million to 1.2 million.”

    The possible solutions are complex and layered and not ones that will be popular with a corporate-driven business model. Under our noses, we’ve let our prisons become factories for some of our biggest industries. Michelle Chen of *The Nation *writes that an “incarcerated person may be surveilled at his facility constantly by taxpayer-funded 3M tracking devices. He might manufacture license plates in prison factories, which are supplied by 3M’s reflective coatings. Post-release, if he manages to pass the background check, he might land a job at a 3M warehouse, joining a workforce infamous for its links to the prison industrial complex as well as labor and environmental violations in the mainstream economy. And both in and out of prison, the company extracts profits from commercialized social control.”

    Global Research found in its exhaustive report on the business of prisons that “this multimillion dollar industry has its own trade exhibitions, conventions, websites, and mail-order/Internet catalogs. It also has direct advertising campaigns, architecture companies, construction companies, investment houses on Wall Street, plumbing supply companies, food supply companies, armed security, and padded cells in a large variety of colors.”

    That doesn’t sound like a model for reforming prisoners considering we have a recidivism rate close to 70 percent. Rather, it’s a model of a corporation, of a business with a bottomline and investors to please. And that’s one of the driving components of the documentary I’m developing and of the frustration I feel for a broken, corrupt system. We’re not doing enough to change because we’re not even trying to reform those that enter into the system.

    Reform is not good business for the prisons that need to fill beds to meet the needs of their corporate sponsors.

    If that sounds crazy, consider this: an Arizona private prison, run by Management & Training Corp., threatened to sue the state because a line in their contract guaranteed that the prison would remain 97 percent full, arguing that they had lost nearly $10 million from the reduced inmate population. State officials renegotiated the contract but ended up paying $3 million for empty beds as the company continued to address problems.

    There’s only one reason prisons need to stay full: the inmates are their workforce, their commodity, and both are essential for a healthy bottom line. They’re not even trying to hide it, but somehow we’re not paying attention.
    I’m paying attention. I want to shine a light on how this continues to happen right under our noses and with taxpayer money. I’m not sure exactly where this story–this journey to have an honest evaluation of how 2 million U.S. citizens (the equivalent of the population of New Mexico) not only end up, but stay incarcerated–will take me, but I know where I’m driving it toward: real solutions that instigate real reforms.

    Stay tuned; because this journey will be unlike any film I’ve ever done. But it will also be the most important film I’ve ever done.

  title: The Tipping Point 101 in three easy steps
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    In 2012 a New York Times columnist decried the need for extensive prison reform but said candidly that the political will to enact changes every lawmaker knew was needed didn’t exist. To suggest prison reform was a poison pill. To even discuss it meant one could be labeled soft on crime. But as we’ve been writing about here for more than a year, the Tipping Point has been coming.

    Now it has clearly arrived as presidential hopefuls and political power brokers from both the left and the right elbow each other for leadership position as reformers.

    After thirty years of relegation to the dark corners of society, the tireless activists and champions who have thanklessly tried to empower ex-inmates to rebuild their lives and re-affirm their basic dignity can be excused for shock at the sudden shift. For many it’s like staring into a harsh sun after years in the darkness of solitary confinement. But no matter how much politicians suddenly trumpet the need, the hundreds of underfunded organization across the country deserve the real credit.

    For those not yet up to speed on this whole notion of prison reform, why it’s needed and how it truly impacts every community across the country, here is a basic primer. Call it the Tipping Point 101 in three easy lessons. Class is in session.

    __Step 1__: The problem, courtesy of the genius of the Vlog Brothers: Lot’s of inmates, lots of cost, few solutions. Got it?

    __Step 2__: The change.

    President Obama highlights the need for prison reform immediately after winning re-election. He sends up a flare, [issuing pardons](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/19/obama-pardon-crack-cocaine_n_4474876.html) for a handful of carefully chosen, “ideal” examples. These test cases don’t raise the backlash that would have been a storm just a year or two ago. The shift begins and the battleship that is the industrialized prison system begins to turn.

    U.S. Attorney Eric Holder begins speaking out about the disparate incarceration of people of color. The Justice Department begins to revamp its sentencing guidelines. Conservatives join the act, including the likes of Sen. Rand Paul and Gov. Rick Perry claiming the need to be “smart on crime.”

    Then in the same week earlier this month, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York issues a new initiative on prison reform and Sens. Paul and Corey Booker [issue federal legislation](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/07/08/cory-booker-rand-paul-team-up-on-sentencing-reform-bill/) called the REDEEM Act. The Tipping Point has officially arrived. As an article earlier in this week stated, “Simply put, Republicans have helped make this the greatest Congress ever for pot smokers and thieves.”

    Thank God. Suddenly the “political will” has arrived. Why? Well annual costs of upwards to $74 billion a year tends to be a powerful motivator.

    __Step Three__:   The solution.

    Innovation that taps into the entrepreneurial spirit that is alive and well (and needed since so many know the typical “job” application will eliminate them from many good jobs) turns inmates into innovators. Many great solutions like our Inside Innovations will soon be pumping renewed life into prisons and empowering people long discarded.

    Got it? Now you are caught up. The Tipping Point has arrived. How it leads to genuine reform remains to be seen, but the attention of communities that demand better than mass incarceration and unsustainable costs will help.

  title: Exonerees face long odds in “so-called free world”
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "I read a story by a writer I’ve met via email a couple
    of times. In a day and age with so much to read out over so many different ways
    to experience it, it is becoming increasingly rare for me to sit a read an entire
    long-form journalistic piece.\n\nThis shames me a bit, because writing long-form
    journalism is my favorite part of my job when I get the opportunity. I also think
    it’s where the future of journalism is headed, directly opposed to the tidbits,
    bullet points, click-happy, Internet-driven fodder that churns relentless over
    the wireless airwaves of today.\n\nSo when I find a compelling story that grabs
    me, draws me in and keeps me reading for a good 20 or 30 minutes or even more,
    it is special.\n[This story](http://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/exonerated-and-out-of-prison-and-thats-when-the-trouble-star#.bfkLk1ykM),
    by Buzzfeed’s Albert Samaha is special. Very special. Samaha captures the crux
    of an emerging national problem: more than hundreds people a year are leaving
    prison, exonerated for their crimes after doing lengthy, unjust sentences despite
    their innocence. These exonerees face terribly long odds in their transition to
    what Clarence Harrison says in Samaha’s piece, “the so-called free world.”\n\nThe
    denial of how many innocent people are in prison for years and years remains one
    of the most difficult hurdles for society to overcome. Yet it’s essential if we
    are to craft the significant reforms this broken billion-dollar boondoggle we
    call our prison system needs.\n\nJust one example: A few years back I was in a
    prison rehab program. Six months, 15 hours a day. Six days a week. Intensive.
    Tough. If you fail you lose your early release privileges, and you can fail for
    most any reason. During that time I heard a counselor say that in six years working
    in the program with hundreds coming through each year he had never known a single
    innocent inmate. He said this with a straight face and utter believability despite
    the simple fact that to express your innocence in such a program is to fail for
    refusing to take responsibility for your crime.\n\nThis is the disconnect that
    must be addressed, because we know for a fact that hundreds of people are convicted
    of life sentences and death sentences for crimes they didn’t commit. Those are
    just the one lengthy enough to fight the decades-long appeals battle for freedom.\n\nHundreds
    of people, every single year are being found innocent and dumped back into society’s
    so-called free world. Consider that a moment.\n\nOur own Antonio Yarbough was
    one of those, more celebrated than others because he was among the first of what
    will likely be dozens to be exonerated in Brooklyn, New York. Dozens… from one
    borough of one city. One day, Yarbough was in the only home he’d known as an adult–
    the Supermax prison at Attica– and then 48 hours later he was free and speaking
    to Piers Morgan on CNN. He was also couch surfing and virtually penniless. Life
    in the so-called free world.\n\nYet somehow, Tony has done well. He is unusual
    in that regard. Most don’t, according to Samaha’s article. Most suffer the fate
    of Harrison who, “was financially illiterate” at the age of 50 when he returned
    to the so-called free world. Harrison was awarded a million dollar settlement.
    He lost it all. But how it he lost it, and how he continues to advocate for criminal
    justice reform is what makes this story so compelling.\n\nThe single best part
    of the job of a writer is this: a story well told. This may be one of the best
    I’ve read in recent years to accomplish just that.\n\n> Before the state of Georgia
    gave him a million dollars and before he lost it all, Clarence Harrison was convicted
    of rape and robbery and sentenced to life in prison in 1987. Years passed. His
    wife divorced him. He became estranged from his two young daughters. His mother
    died. He got cancer and had a kidney removed. He lost hope. He stopped communicating
    with everybody on the outside. He resigned himself to spending the rest of his
    life behind bars and being buried in the prison cemetery, which inmates called
    Pissant Hill.\n> \n> Then in 2004, 18 years after he was arrested, a DNA test
    proved that he was innocent."

  title: Tech tools help inmates re-enter society
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The problem is simple: Two-thirds of the people who ever enter prison will return. The stigmas of the label “felon” cuts many off at the knees, branding them as members of America’s outcast society.

    The solutions are elusive. Efforts to drop the rate of recidivism have failed to move the needle significantly over the past two decades, a time when new mandatory sentencing laws and massive prison construction budgets unleashed an epidemic on incarceration. Now more than seven million people are under some type of supervision in America.

    As a report in *San Francisco Magazine* [stated](http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-inmates-and-the-entrepreneur), “If the current incarceration rates persist, 11 percent of boys born in 2001—and 32 percent of African-American boys—will serve prison time, the U.S. Department of Justice predicts. Eventually, 95 percent of them will be released back into society. The answer to the question ‘Then what?’ has eluded our nation for decades.”

    One pilot project working largely from California’s notorious San Quentin prison trains select inmates prior to their release and equips them with paid internships once they are free. Dubbed “The Last Mile,” this program combines tech incubator training with online fundraising in an intensive six-month training program. The learn social media skills and develop a “personal brand,” according to the co-founders.

    The program has attracted a ton of media interest with its built-in story line of tech professional and inmates connecting in prison classrooms. It’s innovative and creative and for the select few who are chosen to participate, it is life-changing. One such individual launched a fund-raising program designed to help other parolees with basic needs when they are released. Donate to his program, “Paving The Road To Success,” by [clicking here](https://rally.org/pavingtheroadtosuccess).

    This the best part of this truly innovative program. Graduates become “lifetime mentors.” They sign an oath. As they make their own way back into society they look back to others to lend a helping hand. Though a miniscule number of inmates can participate, as graduates of the program develop ways to mentor others, its reach will grow more inclusive. More importantly its a model that works, something sorely lacking within the current environment of most prisons that do little more than warehouse human beings as the clock ticks away, eroding what is left of their lives.

    Vote with your dollars and send this organization a few bucks so it can continue to make a positive difference in a terrible place.

  title: 'Dirty secret: Right to trial often brings harsh punishment'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The story of Travion Blount goes back eight years to a night in Norfolk, Va. and highlights an often overlooked reality within the criminal justice system: Those who exercise their right to trial are often severely punished if found guilty.

    Most of those who have never been caught in the gears of the criminal justice system can’t understand why so many people take deals, even at times when they aren’t guilty of what they’ve been charged of. It’s hard to explain the pressure that can be brought to bear. But this story, that I wrote for Your Black World is a perfect, albeit extreme, example.

    In Blount’s case he exercised that right – “took it to the box,” as it’s called in prison jargon – while his two co-defendants took deals.  The deals were for 10 and 13 years. Blount was sentenced to six life sentences plus 118 years.

    Blount faced life without parole, or “all day” as it’s called in prison. In 2102, the United States Supreme Court ruled against sentencing juveniles to life without parole, yet the practice continues. [According to the ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/human-rights_racial-justice/end-juvenile-life-without-parole), nearly 3,000 people are serving life without parole sentences from juvenile convictions.

    Then just 15, Blount joined 18-year-olds Morris Downing and David Nichols in an armed robbery. According to published reports, the three teens forced partygoers to give up their cellphones, money and marijuana at gunpoint.  No one was injured.

    “The Virginia judge in his case issued one of the harshest sentences ever handed down to a juvenile in the United States for a non-homicide-related offense, equivalent to four felonies for every person who was present at the party,” Sonali Kolhatkar wrote for Truthdig.com.

    Marc Schindler, executive director of the Justice Policy said mandatory minimum sentencing and a harsh manipulation of charges piled on top of each other contributed to Blount’s extreme sentence.

    Blount, 23, has been in prison for eight years. Supporters continue to lobby for post-conviction relief, including a Change.org petition calling for Virginia Gov. Terry McAulife, D-Va., to reduce or commute Blount’s sentence.

    “On March 12, 2008 Travion was sentenced under Judge Charles D. Griffith and told everyone that gun convictions came with set punishments under Virginia law. Judge Griffith clearly took this law to the extreme,” the petition states.

    The sentence shocked all in the courtroom including the reporters assigned to cover it.

    “As he went through the breakdown of weapons charges at his sentencing it totaled to a shocking 118 years. After stating this shocking and cruel calculation of time he then addressed the remaining 25 felony convictions that ruled in six life sentences,” wrote.

    The petition effort has already brought some success. Outgoing Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell issued a partial pardon, reducing Blount’s sentence to 40 years with the potential for parole. Blount’s sentence is still more than three times the length of his codefendants who were both adults at the time of robbery.

    Janet V. Kelly, secretary of the commonwealth under McDonnell, said the governor considered Blount’s criminal history and conduct in prison. McDonnell believed a reduction to 40 years was a “just punishment,” she said, according to published reports.

    But Blount’s family members remained stunned by the severity of the sentence even after being reduced.

    “Forty years. Wow. I mean, why?” his mother, Angela Blount, said.

    If Blount serves the minimum sentence, he will be about 50 when he is released.

    “I’m pleased that, from now on, every waking moment of his life, Travion Blount knows he won’t die in prison,” John Coggeshall, Blount’s lawyer, said.

    Coggeshall said he would continue to work through the courts and legislature to further reduce Blount’s sentence.

    As reported by Hansen, Blount could get further relief through new legislation in the General Assembly.

    “The proposal, authored by state Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax, would allow a panel of judges to review sentences of juvenile offenders facing life for nonhomicide crimes after they have served at least 20 years. Blount is one of 22 Virginia inmates given life without parole for crimes not involving homicide,” she wrote.

    Joe Dillard, president of the Norfolk chapter of the NAACP, said the organization wants Blount to receive a sentence similar to the co-defendants.

    “We’re not going to stop here,” he said.

    Supporters of Blount held a rally for him on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Norfolk earlier this year.

    Monique Santiage, legal advocate to Travion Blount and the author of the [Change.org petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/15-years-old-sentenced-to-118-years-and-6-life-sentences-for-a-robbery-we-are-seeking-justice-for-travion-blount), told the audience that “Travion needed structure, direction, and guidance,” she said. “Travion made a very immature mistake that he is paying for. This is definitely an injustice.”

    Blount’s mother Angela also spoke to the crowd, encouraging them to continue to pray and speak out for justice for her son.

    Better still: Focus energy on the practice of punishing defendants for exercising their right to trial. Of all the broken gears in the industrialized prison machine, this one is perhaps the most destructive of justice.

  title: 'Letter to Al: Hope never dies'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I say it often to remind myself: Hope never dies. But it does take a beating more often than not, which I guess its why its so important to remember that hope never dies.

    Last week, Rick dropped me a New Year’s email of cheer and in it dropped some news that knocked me flat. It wasn’t unexpected, but it still felt like one of those knock-out rib punches that suck the air from your body and turn your brain to mush.  Our mutual friend Al was back inside he told me, “for a long time.”

    That was all he said. I emailed him back right away for details. I couldn’t find information about Al in the news. For more than a day I fretted about him. Finally, I found his information on the prison information website. Sure enough he was back in prison. His mug shot showed a gaunt, older face than the glowing person I remembered. Then I went to the line that had his release date: September 2041 it said.

    That’s when I felt the blow.

    Al is 43. He will be 70 when he gets out. I can’t believe the waste. I read through his charges — kidnapping, rape, possession of a firearm — and I couldn’t make those pieces of information fit with the man I knew inside. Al is physically huge, the grandson of a famous football player and a man who likely would have been a star of his own had his life not gone awry with drugs and crime. When I met him he was doing time for identity theft of a professional football player. It worked so well because he physically fit the bill.

    His personality was magnetic. He radiated positivity. He befriended everyone. He could care less about prison politics or racial alignment or the hustle inside. He tutored other men and helped them earn their GEDs. Staff loved him. One of the most spiritual moments I ever spent inside was standing with Al and two others, all different races and backgrounds, our hands shoved deep into our the pockets of our denim prison coats to beat back the cold while we talked of God, sung songs and gathered in a circle of prayer oblivious to the hundred other men walking the yard engaged in the inane and mundane of prison life. Al was one of the few men I gave my wife’s phone number to when he got out so she could assist him in getting a movers job with her company.

    In short, I couldn’t have been more wrong about Al. But as I said at the start of this blog, I was not shocked when Rick told me the bad news.  Rick used to call him Yogi and it was slightly derisive.  He challenged Al often on being a con man. He told him he doubted his sincerity. Rick seemed to see through Al in way the rest of us didn’t. Also, one of those men in the prayer circle that night said he had the same worries about Al. When Al got out we all wondered which way he would go.

    He left glowing. He was in incredible shape, easily the strongest man on the yard. He could still run faster than young men half his age. His routine of prayer and exercise and positive service proved his discipline. He and I spoke about his plans. They were good plans.

    Still we worried. Was it authentic? Would it last. Less than two weeks went by when the word filtered back that Al had blown off his parole officer. A few months later when Rick got out, he wrote me and said he had run into Al in a grocery store. It seemed obvious he was using again.

    I knew it was only a matter of time when he’d be back inside. But even then I didn’t expect this. I hoped for a short drug-related sentence that would force him into the rehab program he didn’t want to do when offered. I hoped one more of the many chances he had would be enough to tap into all  that obvious potential and energy and turn an authentic, positive Al loose on the world.

    My hopes were dashed as I read the news of 27 long years.

    Is Al personally beyond hope? Is he “evil” as the prison system that chews people up like grist in the industrialized prison machine believes? Can we just blame the evil of drugs that robs us of the sober person we once knew?

    Thank God that’s not for me to say. I have no idea.

    I do know the Al I knew and it’s not the one outside the bars. The one inside is the bars is a man worth saving, even if it seems the Al outside the bars is a man who can’t save himself and does terrible damage to others in his own destructive ways.

    So what now, I asked myself?

    A new plan. Somehow Al has to find a way to become the authentic version of himself while inside. He has to find hope and purpose inside. He has to envision a productive life inside with the faint goal of enjoying a small last slice out life outside when and if he gets out. It isn’t much, but I’ve seen incredible men with far less accomplish far more.

    What now? Write Al, I thought. And I did.

    What do you say in a letter like that? Not much. Just you are still not alone. I will write. I will offer what meager help I can. I will challenge you to find purpose and meaning and health with the life you now must lead. The rest is up to him. Whether he writes me back or not, really doesn’t matter. What matters is a human being is terrible thing to waste, and even at this bleak juncture, hope remains… hope never dies.

    My heart goes out to Al’s victim. I can’t imagine what he put you through. I can’t imagine you ever wanting anything other than revenge and rightly so, I guess. But rest assured Al is locked up now and won’t be a threat to others on the outside like he was to you. That’s the one thing the prison system gets right.

    But forgive me in that my heart still goes out to Al. I know what was inside there once. I hope it can reclaimed again. Maybe what Al learns is something that will help Travis. Or maybe it will be the other way around? Who knows? We can only hope. It seems as important a work as any. If we can help men like Al recapture hope, life rightly, give back and be productive, even when most hope is gone, then we have truly learned something valuable I think.

    Because hope never dies.

  title: Time has finally come for restorative justice
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    In this “tough on crime” era of brass knuckle, truth bending politics, the political will for restorative justice programs did not exist. Not even close.

    But that didn’t stop several visionary organizations around the country to keep trying, doggedly spreading a message that justice could also be something that restores both victim and offender to a better place.

    Restorative justice could be too easily attacked for being soft. It could be dismissed in the hot breath of revenge and hate. And for years and years it has been ignored, even while quietly, doggedly, persistently proving that the endless cycle of incarceration could be broken.

    Justice Fellowship was one of those early pioneers.

    The conservative theology of Chuck Colson may trip people up, but the results should speak the loudest. Within global prisons it would be difficult, dare we say impossible, to find a more effective organization in combating rampant recidivism in this age of epidemic incarceration.

    How ironic it is that Colson, a stunning example of true compassionate conservatism, devoted his life to an effort that few conservatives had the time to entertain. Still that didn’t sway the ministry or message or the faith of this courageous leader who died in 2012. He doggedly built one of the most important, compassionate and successful prison reform organizations in the world, while never straying from his conservative convictions.

    For baseball fans it helps to think of the past thirty years as the steroid era of imprisonment. Every thing was out-sized. The hitters dominated exploding all previous records. In this analogy, the criminal justice system is the juiced sluggers wielding the bats. Those working for reform were like beleaguered pitchers of the steroid era.

    Justice Fellowship was formed under the direction of Colson to offer real solutions to criminal actions with a better hope of change — and placing a value on all human beings — that the existing system of rampant incarceration. That better hope is [restorative justice](http://www.justicefellowship.org/building-restorative-justice), which still has not caught on within the criminal justice system.

    But as the tipping point approaches, the time for programs that truly work has come. Those long, difficult years working in obscurity and against an epidemic tide of prison build up could soon pay off as leaders from both parties look for any hope of decarceration in the years to come.

  title: Boyd’s ‘Gone Camping’ ties lessons of business, prison
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    In the 1990s Bob Boyd’s role as legal counsel and co-founder for a hedge fund earned him a lavish lifestyle, success and esteem. He shook hands with President Bill Clinton. He could talk about money in terms of billions with B, and do so credibly.

    By 2001 he knew a series of bad decisions had exposed him and his partners to more than just financial risk. He resigned from his own company, a company than eventually went bankrupt. Nothing draws government attention like massive business losses. Soon the federal government’s criminal investigators came calling. Eventually those calls landed him a USP Big Sandy.

    Boyd captures the lessons learned while building a billion-dollar hedge fund and while navigating the unique culture behind the barbed wires and bars of an American prison in his book *[Gone Camping: from hedge fund thinking to inmate wisdom](http://www.amazon.com/gone-camping-Bob-Boyd/dp/0996025006)*.

    Boyd expertly avoids the convoluted verbage of his expertise–be it legal, high finance or lowly prison slang–and tells his story and lessons learned in a clear style that effectively communicates both the hedge fund thinking and prison wisdom that shaped his life.

    Boyd is the first person I’ve run into that approached prison with the same simple goal that I did.
    > “My best revenge is to get healthy and add years to my life. My sentence is three years, so I plan to exercise and diet to extend my life by more than three years. A net gain from the camp experience as I see it."

    Like Boyd, I too started slow circles around a prison track when I couldn’t run a half of a mile with having to walk and gasping with pain as I did. Like Boyd, I slowly put together longer runs as the weight of my excess lifestyle fell off. Like Boyd I soon (and still do) enjoyed running six miles as a regular workout. We both likely added years to our lives.

    In all that circling the track like a hamster on a Habitrail, I learned that I didn’t need or want revenge. I just wanted to find the best me again. Boyd experiences something similar during an interaction with an inmate.

    “I feel best about myself when helping others,” Boyd writes.

    Like the six-mile runs, this similar realization I discovered during my time inside continues today and helps me keep evolving toward my best self.

    The experience of needed change, the pin in the bubble of hubris that both Boyd and I experienced from our prison terms, begins early on for those wanting to change their lives. Some don’t ever grasp it. Boyd did.

    “The decision to grow from prison is one of the most important decisions I will ever make,” Boyd writes.

    As I think back through seminal moments of my life, I think that decision now shapes my life more than any single thing I have ever done or decided save for an intimate experience with a loving God.

    *Gone Camping* hits its mark, a unique business book for those who are comfortable speaking the language of entrepreneurs, investors and financial risk-takers. It’s less a cautionary tale and more a straight-forward story that offers something akin to bumpers in your business bowling lane. It may not be as flashy as a swooping curve for a strike, but if Boyd’s simple wisdom is followed, the terrible gutter balls that cost people so dearly can be avoided.

    Boyd’s analytic approach to his prison sentence and the observations such an approach gained is the unique perspective of his book. But more importantly, it’s the unique perspective of doing no harm and recognizing our risks hurt so many other people, regardless of our best (and even worst) intentions. In this way I can most empathize with Boyd and celebrate the lessons he learned.

    > “Being sentenced to prison is nothing to be proud of,” he writes “Life here at ‘the country club’ is not fun… But prison is not your punishment. Loss of your self-definition is the punishment. Separation from your family, friends and everything you hold dear is the punishment…. Professionally, a felony is a life sentence and that is the punishment.  Other unfairly suffered and knowing you are part of the cause is the punishment.”

    Understanding that becomes the key to the shift inside each of us, that shift from revenge thinking and anger to humility and service. The shift from defending or reshaping the story of the past, to accepting it for all its truth and all its fiction and embracing yourself as you are. The shift from the past and the future tense being the only focus, to as Boyd describes life in prison, living in the now.

    The now is the one place where we can truly make a difference both within ourselves and in the things we do with our lives. Boyd’s book captures that shift.

  title: 'Estella’s Brilliant Bus #empowering kids'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    With so many powerful and funny and kitschy commercials during the Super Bowl one stood out because the subject of the commercial, Estella Pyfrom stands out.

    Microsoft’s #empowering advertisement push that launched during the Super Bowl featured [Estella’s Brilliant Bus](http://estellasbrilliantbus.org/). The computer giant couldn’t pick a better subject. The retired teacher who used her pension to launch a bus that travels around and teaches tech to kids from disaffected communities is a gem. The idea is unique, its impact measurable and its mobility a way to reach far more than most classroom models.

    Estella has been recognized as a CNN Top Ten Hero in 2013 and in 2014, largely at her own expense, “Estella’s Brilliant Bus Tech Innovation Tour went to the 2014 #YesWeCode Hackathon and Technology Village at the Essence Festival in New Orleans.”

    Her kids won the Hackathon!

    Now she wants to repeat with a whole new six-city tour ending at the 2015 #yeswecode Hackathon. But after paying out so much of her own retirement to give kids an #empowering dream, we need to pitch in. [We need to give $5 to her indiegogo campaign right now, today](https://life.indiegogo.com/fundraisers/empowering-estella-s-brilliant-bus). We need hundreds and hundreds of small donors to show the depth of interest in this remarkable women. Rarely do we cast meaningful votes these days, but today you can cast a vote with a small donation that will give this campaign the lift it needs to attract other larger donors that will put Estella and her brilliant bus in motion across this country with a 21st-century American dream.

    Estella’s work is a powerful shoulder inadvertanly shoving back against the industrialized prison complex in this country. By catching kids early and showing them the power and opportunity of technology, she’s giving a game plan other than a future of crime, drugs and incarceration. In a country where more than 40 percent of young men under the age of 23 will enter the criminal justice system in some manner, and where a whopping 84 percent of those sent to prison before the age of 23 will return, this effort to open the pipeline of productivity to kids slows the flow of the school-to-prison pipeline that has crippled our country.

    Someday soon we’d love to fill a brilliant bus tour with Children of Incarcerated Adultsm the single highest at-risk category in the U.S. We can launch that partnership today by flooding Estella’s campaign with Criminal U donors. Donate and leave a message saying “next stop: Criminal U kids!” We’ll take it from there!

    Please help, right now, today, by [clicking here](https://life.indiegogo.com/fundraisers/empowering-estella-s-brilliant-bus).

    Thanks.

  title: Real Housewife and Husband face real time
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Prison consultants are making big bucks these days as more
    and more celebs, politicians, and executives prepare for enrollment in Criminal
    U. These are folks with serious money who are striped naked, searched, put into
    prison scrubs and turned loose in the cellblocks of America’s prisons. They have
    been known to pay big bucks to prison consultants across the country who prepare
    them for life inside.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nTwo more who might be looking
    for advice are Teresa Giudice and Joe Giudice, whose 15 seconds of reality show
    fame will cost them dearly in the months ahead. The former Real Housewife of New
    Jersey and her husband pleaded guilty to several mortgage and bankruptcy fraud
    charges on Tuesday, March 4.\n\n*Us Weekly* reports:\n> “The Giudices were reportedly
    both composed during their court appearance while pleading guilty to several counts
    of bankruptcy fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud, and failing
    to pay taxes. They are scheduled to be sentence on July 8. Joe, an Italian citizen,
    could face deportation.\"\n> \n> “Today, I took responsibility for a series of
    mistakes I made several years ago,” Teresa said in a statement to Us Weekly on
    Tuesday. “I have said throughout that I respect the legal process and thus I intend
    to address the court directly at sentencing. I will describe the choices I made,
    continue to take responsibility for my decisions, and express my remorse to Judge
    Salas and the public.”\n\nI hadn’t ever heard of these people. I guess I didn’t
    get the channel on my 8-inch prison TV when these folks made their splash. But
    my wife knew of them. She watched the show. She was bummed when she heard they
    were going to prison.\n\nAll I can think is how much they have to learn.\n\nFor
    starters, has anyone explained that they are now co-defendants. In most states
    that means the Department of Corrections will block all contact between them.
    They will never be able to call each other. Letters may be blocked. If they try
    to get someone on the outside to three-way call and connect them, their phone
    privileges will be cut off.\n\nThey will have to care for their children without
    any communication whatsoever. Once Teresa gets out — she has the likely shorter
    prison sentence — she will be blocked from visiting her husband. When Joe gets
    out he may well be blocked from going to the family home, because parole officers
    may not want any contact between the two lest they plan another crime.\n\nTheir
    marriage license means virtually nothing any longer. The state will determine
    when and if they reunite for the next several years. The couple has four daughters
    ages 5 to 13. The reality is they may be adults and teenagers before their family
    is reunited once they go to prison.\n\nPaying a debt to society is a part of justice.
    But one has to wonder, is this justice?\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning of the
    lessons that await these former reality TV stars. Life is about to get very, very
    real indeed."

  title: Private prisons still sneaky stock for big profits
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    For the past ten years, private prison companies have been a favorite of many Wall Street investors. What other business has growth all but assured by the government? What other business has enjoyed such radical growth? What other business can face numerous lawsuits, a steady stream of terrible publicity and still remain largely unaffected?

    Despite news reports in numerous states that reveal the terrible conditions in private prisons, investors seem unconcerned. Unlike many stocks that are teetering wildly on public perception, private prison operators Corrections Corporation of America and GEO Group, at least so far, have been largely immune from the negative effects of bad press.

    Prison economies enjoyed a tremendous boom for the past decade as “tough-on-crime” legislation and mandatory minimum sentencing exploded the number of people imprisoned in America. This meant more police, more guards, more counselors, more probation and parole officers, more vendors supplying to goods and services and especially more prisons.

    But in this decade the true costs of those inmate populations began to take root in state budgets reeling from the recession looked desperately for financial solvency. A [Time cover story](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/01/28/ http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1997457,00.html#ixzz2qOemvXph) that year cited the growing crisis faced by state budgets.

    “From Hartford to Honolulu, once sturdy state governments are approaching the brink of fiscal calamity, as the crash of 2008 and its persistent aftermath have led to the reckoning of 2010,” the article stated.

    The boom years appeared to be drawing to an end. Certainly a surface scan of the recent events suggests as much. Idaho recently took back control of its prison from Corrections Corporations of America. Construction of prisons have stalled in states around the country. Many states have begun efforts to reduce inmate populations because they simply can’t afford to keep locking people up with reckless abandon.

    But that doesn’t stop lawmakers from trying. In one Midwest state the contract between CCA and the state to run its prison, guarantees an “occupancy rate” of 90 percent. How can a “just” government promise a set number of inmates year in and year out? Easily as it turns out.

    So is it bad news for the publicly held companies that rely on revenue streams based on swelling prison economies? Perhaps not.

    CCA’s public statement to the stockholders states that the company is one of the largest prison operators in the United States, “behind only the federal government and three states.”

    The company owns or controls 53 facilities and manages 16 facilities owned by governments. Another significant for-profit, prison operator is the GEO Group. GEO manages 95 facilities in countries like Australia and The United Kingdom in addition to the United States.

    In September, California award a $30-million, three-year contract for 1,400 beds to the GEO Group. The state has been mired in federal receivership over inmate overcrowding and inadequate health services for several years. Gov. Jerry Brown is increasingly looking to private prison operators to help meet the state’s legal responsibilities.

    But how bad do you have to be to lose a contract? Turns out pretty bad as inmates in Idaho recently discovered.

    CCA lost control of the Idaho Corrections Center when the state reversed course and announced earlier this month that it would take over operations of its largest prison after a decade of outsourcing to CCA. The state is investigating a host of complaints regarding operation of the prison. CCA admitted in 2013 that it falsified records submitted to the state that claimed staffing during times that were actually vacant.

    CCA shows little sign of alarm. On the same day in November the company announced its dividend payment it also announced a deal to build a 2,500-bed Trousdale Correctional Center in Trousdale County, Tenn.

    A sea change may be coming, though no political expert would suggest its coming any time soon. But don’t get swayed by some bad press. Rest assured those that matter — the government agencies pressed for cash and increasingly looking to private prison operators — don’t care much about bad press and even less about the human beings under their care.

  title: Clemons continues freedom fight despite daily battles
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Reggie Clemons is not well liked by the state of Missouri.
    This is known. The current governor once vowed to execute him by Christmas, Clemons
    says. Clemons draws attention and continues to claim his innocence, neither of
    which are ever appreciated by those in the Department of Corrections.\n\nClemons
    was sentenced to death in a brutal rape and murder that happened two decades ago
    in the St. Louis area, that is part of the inspiration behind a film called *Trivia*
    slated for [release next year](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1621415/trivia). Nobody
    is denying the horrors of that night. Two young women with much to offer the world
    were brutally raped and murdered. Clemons admits he saw them, met them and then
    left them. Police are convinced he returned to rape them.\n\nClemons categorically
    denies his involvement. He was twice fast approaching his own execution — once
    being just five days away — despite these claims. He had no criminal record prior
    to his arrest for these murders. Finally, a special appointed judge reviewed his
    case and found he has a victim of police abuse and coercion. Virtually everything
    about his case has since been found faulty, including DNA that doesn’t match him.
    Still, he waits on death row for the state Supreme court to rule in his case and
    award him a badly needed new trial.\n\nClemons has also been outspoken against
    the death penalty. In an interview with me [he predicted the problems](http://triceedneywire.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4163:news-analysis-oklahoma-executions-reveal-secrecy-inhumanity-by-andrew-scot-bolsinger&catid=54&Itemid=208)
    that occurred in Oklahoma and Missouri.\n\nInstead of hiding from the spotlight,
    Clemons has sought it, relentlessly pressuring the criminal justice system and
    exposing its flaws. He has several cases against the system. He refuses to back
    down. He has long said he is targeted inside the prison by guards.\n\nSo it surely
    didn’t show his supporters — though it is still unnerving — that he took relatively
    extreme measures to protect himself by entering protective custody. Oddly, he
    is not seeking protection from other inmates, which is unnecessary for him, but
    seeking protection for the guards.\n\nThis is a letter that was sent out on his
    behalf,  by Jamala Rogers, coordinator of a campaign of the Justice for Reggie
    campaign.\n\n> Last month, out of frustration and desperation, Reggie put himself
    into protective custody as a safeguard against mounting prison violations. Reggie
    has been the target of frivolous violations from the guards since his execution
    date was postponed in 2009. At Potosi Correctional Center, if you get a certain
    amount of violations within a particular time period, you will be thrown in administrative
    segregation (“the hole”) for a whole year. Reggie was trying to avoid being pushed
    over this cliff.\n> \nThis is no publicity stunt. An inmate’s quality of life
    declines dramatically in protective custody. He will likely spend 23 hours a day
    in a cell. Often once in PC, prison officials won’t let the inmate reverse the
    decision later on. He could spend decades in a cell as a result of this decision.
    Just how bad did it have to be?  Only Clemons knows.\n\nClemons has won the support
    of Amnesty International and high-profile activists like Danny Glover, Dick Gregory
    and Bianca Jagger. His mother has been a tireless and well-spoken advocate. The
    high court’s decision looms. Tensions are high.\n\nSomething positive can be done,
    however:\n> Reggie has asked that his supporters write, call or fax George Lombardi,
    director of the department of corrections, asking that the guards cease their
    harassment. Please send the Campaign a copy of your written correspondence. If
    you call, let us know the prison’s response.\n\nContact information is:\nGeorge
    Lombardi\n2729 Plaza Drive\nJefferson City, MO  65102\n573.751.2389  (phone) 573.751.4099
    \ (fax)\nJamala Rogers, Coordinator\nJUSTICE for Reggie Campaign\nP. O. Box 5277
    \ St. Louis, MO  63115\n(314) 367-5959\nwww.justiceforreggie.com\n\nMany in the
    local area see Clemons the way he was painted early, a rapist, murderer and a
    conniver. Perhaps he is all those things. I’ve spoken with him often and find
    him likable. He is thoughtful, articulate and convincing of his innocence. Thankfully,
    I don’t have to decide his guilt.\n\nI am convinced — absolutely convinced — he
    deserves another trail. The evaluating judge called the police work so poor  —
    “so shoddy,” he wrote — that it lacks credibility. Clemons was beaten. The case
    was a travesty in an area of police work that convicted thousands of men without
    much evidence. We are finally seeing the first flood of exonerations stemming
    from police tactics similar to that employed to convict Clemons.  Few can doubt
    the system has a credibility problem.\n\nWhat is also likely true is a state that
    is among the top five in the country for its executions has little interest in
    a well-spoken inmate gaining a platform for reform that an exoneration would bring.
    It doesn’t take much imagination to know that Clemons’ concerns with his treatment
    by the guards may well be accurate.\n\nJustice requires fair treatment of inmates,
    even outspoken ones. Justice requires a fair trial.  So far it seems Reggie Clemons
    has been given neither. While we wait for the latter, we can do something about
    the former with a simple phone call and/or letter of support that justice prevails."

  title: 'Tale of two QBs: home-field advantage with police'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Football fans on the East and West coast once shared a common concern. Would their star quarterback suddenly land behind bars in Florida following allegations of sexual assault? The answer in both cases, for entirely different reasons, is no, because in the scheme of life, football is one of the few things that tops of ire for sexual assault.

    Sound unbelievable? Well, not to the Florida police involved in the two high-profile cases, the tale of the two QBs of San Francisco 49ers QB Colin Kaepernick and Florida State phenom Jameis Winston. Apparently who they played for made all the difference. Kaepernick, represented the visiting team, which may explain why a brazen allegation made by a woman who would not leave a hotel room that she claimed she’d been assaulted in still made national news. Winston, played for the home team, eventual national champion Florida State Seminoles and apparently had the good fortune of a large rug and officials throughout the state aggressively sweeping under it.

    The incident involving Winston occurred well before his football fame was realized but his potential as a heralded recruit was established. In December 2012 a freshman woman at the university went to police. Tests showed semen in her underwear. Bruises formed on her skin even as she gave her statement, according to the New York Times who decided more than a year later to look under the rug — an effort I’m sure the genteel southerners from Florida considered little more than bad manners.

    “Three weeks after Mr. Winston was publicly identified as the suspect, the storm had passed. The local prosecutor announced that he lacked the evidence to charge Mr. Winston with rape. The quarterback would go on to win the Heisman Trophy and lead Florida State to the national championship,” [The Times reported](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/16/sports/errors-in-inquiry-on-rape-allegations-against-fsu-jameis-winston.html?_r=0).

    What more has to be said about priorities than that. Well, this actually: “In his announcement, the prosecutor, William N. Meggs, acknowledged a number of shortcomings in the police investigation. In fact, an examination by The New York Times has found that there was *virtually no investigation at all*, either by the police or the university.”

    In this era of epidemic, racially motivated incarceration and well-deserved heightened awareness of sexual assaults, it is staggering to think police simply looked the other way of a reported rape by a black man in the south.  But the Times article makes clear they did and for one reason only: football.

    How bad was the investigation: The assault was videotaped, the Times reported, and police never bothered to ask for it.

    “The detective handling the case waited two months to write his first report and then prematurely suspended his inquiry without informing the accuser. By the time the prosecutor got the case, important evidence had disappeared, including the video of the sexual act.

    “‘They just missed all the basic fundamental stuff that you are supposed to do,’ Mr. Meggs said in a recent interview.”

    Winston learned quickly enough that at least in Florida, he is above the law. A second woman came forward with a complaint — to be clear this would not be considered assault because she never said “no” — about the conduct of Winston that was so abusive she felt violated. How many such actions does it take to establish a pattern?

    So is anyone surprised by today’s announcement that Winston is again [in the news for a crime](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2014/04/30/analysis-florida-state-fsu-quarterback-jameis-winston-crab-legs-shoplifting-citation/8526501/), this one the petty theft of $32 in seafood while traveling with the school’s baseball team?

    Criminal thinking is embedded in many of us and it starts with an assurance we are above the law, that somehow the rules don’t apply. Most anyone who has ever been enrolled in Criminal U thought that way at one time. Winston thinks that way still, despite the warning shots fired across his star-studded bow.

    But the real story here is not a coddled QB, but the police who gave him a pass. To fully grasp the work of those who take an oath to defend justice, consider the other high-profile case in Florida this off-season.

    TMZ made its splash with an “exclusive” (which means police leaked it more than likely) story of a police report naming Kaepernick and two others in an alleged sexual assault in Miami. The story so dominated the news that if you type Kaepernick’s name and Florida in a Google search you can page down four pages and not find anything beyond the April 10 allegation news.

    What you don’t find is the story three days later of Kaepernick blasting TMZ for shoddy reporting. What you don’t find is the story eight days later saying police [doubt the QB](http://www.sacbee.com/2014/04/18/6336297/miami-police-dont-believe-kaepernick.html) was in the room at the time the woman called. What you don’t find also eight days later is the report that one of Kap’s friends actually called 9-1-1 first became the supposedly passed out, naked woman was making a scene and wouldn’t leave the hotel room.

    Was Kap an angel? Hell no. But is there even a shred of evidence of sexual assault? It doesn’t seem like it. But that hasn’t stopped Miami police from conducting a through three-week investigation and it didn’t stop police reports being leaked to the likes of TMZ to forever tarnish the name of Colin Kaepernick, who apparently didn’t have the good fortune of playing for Florida State or perhaps the Miami Dolphins. Nobody was around in Florida with brooms or to volunteer to lift the rugs for the likes of a 49er.

    As long as the state of police investigations can be swayed by the likes of what team a man plays for, everyone who doesn’t play is in peril of police tactics that apparently have very little to do with justice, not to mention the victims of those who run across someone who now has proof that the rules — much less the laws of the land — don’t apply to him.

  title: Connecting mass incarceration and American economic survival
  author: R.L. Pelshaw
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Economists, investors and politicians are worried recent “market corrections” could be the harbinger of worse things to come. While businesses are worried, few recognize the solutions offered from America’s prisons.
    I wish more citizens were focused on what Jim Clifton, chairman and CEO of Gallup first heralded in his January 23, 2014, editorial “[Small Business Is Dying](http://www.gallup.com/opinion/chairman/181469/big-lie-unemployment.aspx).”

    Until 2008, the number of small business start-ups always outweighed the closures. After that business starts began to slow. According to Clifton, since 2008 the numbers of business closures have overtaken business starts. That apparently was a first for our nation, a sad one. Small businesses are responsible for the majority of all new job creation.

    When we lose small businesses, we lose the innovation, independence and work ethic that give America a unique trading advantage over other countries. We need these advantages – Lord knows we cannot compete on price (nor should we, since we have such a high standard of living we all wish to maintain).

    Is it mere coincidence that during the period small business start-ups slowed, we also had the most aggressive expansion of mass incarceration? Certainly not. We are caging many would-be entrepreneurs and branding them with a stigma that will make it nearly impossible for them to obtain good jobs and return to society as productive citizens. The costs of incarceration are the second highest fiscal obligation of most states, totaling $54 billion nationally. Only Medicare costs more.

    Nearly 25 percent of the entire population has some sort of a criminal record. Many employers won’t hire anyone with a criminal history. How can we be competitive or having a growing GDP, when we by-pass such a large portion of our worker pool? As mentioned in the recent article The Five Bottom-Line Reasons Why Employers Should Hire Ex-Felons, my National Hire Ex-Felons Campaign seeks to show employers the bottom-line benefits associated with using this untapped labor pool.

    Mass Incarceration is a two-edged sword that cuts both ways: the fiscal costs of mass incarceration and the opportunity cost of lost productivity from a growing segment of our population that is becoming less productive at an increasing rate. If left unchecked the combination of growing fiscal costs with lesser productivity have the potential of harming, if not eventually, crippling our economy.

    Many employers will capitalize on the benefits of hiring someone with a criminal record. Many won’t. There likely won’t be enough jobs to keep a financially strapped, unemployed or under-employed former felon away from succumbing to the temptation to return to crime to survive. That’s how the cycle of crime continues.

    A tremendous opportunity is revealed through this problem. I wrote the book Illegal To Legal to give the formerly incarcerated and those at risk of incarceration, options to support themselves other than crime. Using a strengths-based perspective, the book shows how to take your life skills and passions and channel those into a successful business.

    Wouldn’t it be amazing if the underdogs saved the day for our nation? What if the formerly incarcerated and currently at risk– the very ones who were a fiscal drain on the system – became self-employed and hired workers other companies wouldn’t? We would save more than money.  We could save the innovation, independence, and work ethic that make America great.  We might just save this nation in the process.

  title: Oakland’s Planting Justice grows good people, food at same time
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I met Anthony on the street in Jackson Square. We started “chopping it up” as they say inside Criminal U.

    His infectious personality promoted an organization called [Planting Justice](http://www.plantingjustice.org/). It was readily apparent he believed in the project more than just trying to get donations. We got that out of the way first and then spoke about our shared journeys beyond Criminal U.

    “The help comes inside but you have to find it. I started about two years before I was fittin’ to come home. I started doing resumes. I started looking for jobs in the paper. I started doing everything I possibly could,” he told me.

    Anthony learned master gardening skills while at San Quentin.  As a graduate of the program he was given a job when he got out. He’s studying for an advanced degree in horticulture.

    Planting food in urban areas has become both an occupation and a vocation.  Through this calling he’s offering new hope for others, especially kids. He’s directing them down  other roads than the one we traveled, the fast lane roads that dead-end in prison cells.

    Anthony swapped photos with us about his different projects, including an Oakland school where they put in new planters that were soon overflowing with produce.

    I had to cut him off with the one question that had nagged me from the moment he first approached us.

    “What’s with the Raiders cap and 49er T-shirt?” I asked.

    He laughed and confessed it was straight marketing. Knowing he was in SF, he wore the Niner shirt. But knowing a certain audience would be turned off, he donned the Raider hat.

    “I wanted to catch people’s attention. I just put the hat on to see how many people it attracted… I know how to roll whatever they say, you know.”

    A true entrepreneurial approach to raising donors for a truly inspiring program.

    “If you don’t knock on doors, no doors will open,” Anthony said. “I’ve been blessed.”

    It never fails to amaze me how many people I’ve run into who have shared the experiences in the worst of environments but see only bright skies ahead.

    “I’ve been blessed,” they say, a reminder to me of something I say to myself everyday.

  contentAboveNewsletter: "Michael Amity provided a recent clip about the differences
    of a white man and a black man trying to get into a car. But using a perfectly
    clear little video, he goes on to describe the basic institutional racism that
    fueled our epidemic rise of mass incarceration. [This is must see TV](https://youtu.be/MuyMuLGXxTs),
    if you want to quickly be informed.\n\n> The incarceration numbers are proof our
    system unfairly targets black people at no less than 6 times the rate of whites.\n>
    \n> Further, it regularly targets non-violent deviants more than violent offenders.
    Take for example the case of Ethan Couch, a 16 year old white kid who killed four
    people in an accident while drunk driving. Not that I’m a lawyer, but I think
    a vehicular manslaughter conviction or something to put his delinquent self in
    juvenile lock-up was in order. Instead, he got off.\n> \n> Sadly, this could happen
    again, as nothing is in the works to change a punitive system that operates with
    a ridiculous set of priorities. Couch was ordered just to attend rehab, while
    over a half million people caught with drugs are not afforded the same treatment.\n>
    \n> Tying this back to the race aspect of inequity, I think the point is, generally,
    it isn’t possible to be equal with such ingrained beliefs related to stereotypes.
    If we let generalizations go unnoticed, we fall into stigmatization that serves
    no improvements.\n> \n> Racism is institutionalized (perpetual) discrimination.
    Ethan Couch, if he has any conscience, knows he did wrong and serve in a mental
    prison, but will not be put in a physical one. He’ll hear about the public outrage
    over the judge’s infamous citing “affluenza” as the reason for letting the boy
    off with just a slap on the wrist.\n> \n> Consider that as long as privilege is
    allowed to operate blatantly and without consequence, we will all suffer at the
    hands of it. Not just the victims of disparity, but also the perpetrators will
    suffer, albeit only subconsciously. Couch knows he got away with killing four
    people as a result of privilege, and it being publicly stated now, that it was
    in fact–not theory–due to class, means privilege should be on people’s minds.\n\nvia

  title: Senghor completes rise beyond prisons
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |
    Shaka Senghor’s childhood in Detroit went mostly according to plan. He was abused as a child, a victim of gun violence as a teen, a criminal drug dealer and eventually the man squeezing the trigger. Another man died, Senghor ended up in prison, a slick slide down the school-to-prison pipeline that fueled the industrialized prison industry for the last three decades. The plan didn’t include life beyond prisons.

    What happened next was was anything but the plan. While serving 19 years, seven in solitary, Senghor defied the odds — and the plan — and changed the course of his life.

    “I was sent to prison at the age of 19 for second-degree murder. I spent my time reading and writing, using books to free my mind and expand my thinking. I clung to words–my own and others–as I pulled myself out of the anger that led me to prison and kept me from reaching my full potential,” he says now.

    Like those who have been inside Criminal U, Senghor saw the brokenness all around him. Unlike many, he saw it in himself as well. He faced it. He figured out how to heal and began to envision life beyond prison.

    So what’s all this about some plan, you may ask? It’s not like his plan for life was kill someone and end up in prison. It’s not like police and public officials sit around and say, “hey, this kid will use a gun, then we can lock him up.”

    But somehow that became expected, even the norm, in places like Detroit, and Oakland, and Richmond, and urban locations all over the country until we became a nation that sent hundreds of thousands of people–mostly young men, and disproportionately black men–to prison.

    Maybe saying such pain and brokenness “was the plan” is too jaded. But plan or not, our entire system ignored a truth that Senghor discovered in his personal reclamation project.

    “Hurt people hurt people, and a lot of people are hurting,” he says. “We keep turning a deaf ear to their pain.”

    Senghor’s new memoir, [Writing My Wrongs](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-My-Wrongs-Redemption-American/dp/1101907290), chronicles his story. It has captivated readers since its release earlier this month, already hitting the New York Times Best Seller list. It captivated Oprah for goodness sakes. Oprah, mind you.

    > “My first glance at the person on the book’s cover—a dreadlocked, tattooed, heavyset blackmale—left me skeptical. Full of judgment,” said Oprah. “‘Why should I be interested in the story of a murderer?’ But as his words unfolded, so did my understanding—of what it means to fall short, to go astray, to lose your way.”

    Senghor’s life has gone to a new plan since a turning point in prison, inspired by a letter from his young son. He was twice denied parole but made a vow to the parole board that if he were ever released, he would dedicate his life to helping others and becoming a writer.

    On June 22, 2010, one day after his 38th birthday, he was released from prison and was finally a free man. He stood by his words he shared with the parole board member, his family, and friends and became an activist and mentor to young men and women facing circumstances like his. His work in the community and the courage to share his story led him to fellowships at the MIT Media Lab and the Kellogg Foundation and invitations to speak at events like TED and the Aspen Ideas Festival.

    Senghor has emerged as a leading voice for reform. More importantly, he represents the wealth of talent that exists among the millions of Criminal U alumni. Many, like Senghor, are deeply committed to the reform movement, and most have both talent and experience that is critical to genuine reform. The more ex-inmates like Senghor sit at the table of reform, the more likely that effort will be successful at changing a system that to date has proven adept of breaking the human spirit.

    Senghor is both an example and a voice for the human potential that exists in the bleakest places on Earth. His is a call to all of us, to do what we can to reclaim that human potential both within ourselves and with those we connect with every day.

  title: 'Brian Foster: Mandatory minimum sentencing gone awry'
  author: Stephanie Allen-Gobert
  contentAboveNewsletter: "I just read a touching story that touched all the bases
    and hit me dead in the heart. It’s the story of a young man given way too much
    time who has fallen victim to the unjust and unfair federal sentencing guidelines
    and its senseless mandatory minimum sentencing.\n\nSome might have read my previous
    post about the harsh sentencing given to my husband–a nonviolent drug offender.
    I know my husband is just one of thousands of men and women caught up in the system.
    The story of Brian Foster is another such example.\n\nFoster was sentenced to
    a staggering 27 years based on mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines. His daughter,
    a young woman named Keyonna, wrote a blog to advocate for her father.\n\n> In
    March 2008 the Feds arrested our dad outside his home that was illegally searched.
    The agents lied to search his home with an arrest warrant. This charge would have
    the potential to put him in prison for a minimum of 10 years, and a maximum of
    life. This devastating blow left our dad and family with a cruel and unusual punishment
    of 27 years in Federal prison. The case should have been a state charge because
    there was only 499 grams of cocaine in evidence.\n\nThe case, as it turns out,
    was built as most of the ill-fated War on Drugs has been, with one drug user rolling
    on the next and so on until someone stops the process and goes to trial. In this
    case, Brian Foster went to trial to fight overzealous prosecution that was trying
    to sentence him for aggravated charges beyond his offense, as his daughter explains:\n>
    “(Dad) went to trial, which is a rare thing in these days and times, because most
    defendants are convicted by plea bargains. At trial there was an amount of evidence
    that would be deemed inadmissible and inconsistent with the state law had this
    case been presented in the state. However, the Feds, have what they call 404 evidence,
    which is based on hearsay laws. So much weight is given to what a person says
    that what a person does, therefore snitches are treated as gods to the United
    States attorneys. \n> \n> “The judge seemed to notice that the snitch was lying
    and getting caught up in all types of false statements with too many inconsistencies.
    When the evidence presented in trial doesn’t support the offense charged on the
    indictment the judge can introduce a lesser included instruction to the jury so
    that the defendant can be charged with a lesser charge that carries a lower sentence
    than the original. However, the most compelling significance concerning a lesser
    included offense of the original charge is that the essential elements of the
    lesser and the greater offense must be the same.\"\n\nBecause of this, Foster
    claims he was found guilty by the jury of the lesser included offense given by
    the judge, a conviction of a charge that was not on his indictment.\n\n> “This
    clearly is a violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment Right under the U.S. Constitution.
    The Grand Jury report, criminal complaint, and Indictment dates and testimony
    are not consistent with the snitches testimony at trial. So why did our Dad get
    27 years? because he’s African American, and went to trial.\n> \n> “Our justice
    system is in dire straits for a overhaul in the wake of Reform and rehabilitation.
    There are too many African Americans that are locked up and given a bum deal,
    especially for small amounts of drugs as a result of our archaic draconian system.
    \n> \n> “The power of change is embedded in the will and heart of those who unify.”\n\nKeyonna’s
    fight and her words reminded me so much of my fight and drive to make a change.
    It also helped me understand how my daughter and son must feel with their father
    given so much time based on guidelines that do not seem just. Their father is
    gone, missing crucial time with them.\n\nFoster has been fighting his case for
    more than five years. It’s a fight for sentencing change we have joined at Criminal
    U to help him and thousands of others win. What makes Foster’s case so egregious
    is that even the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years was not enough. Enhancements
    were employed to nearly triple his time.\n\n“Based on the minimum mandatory I
    should have received 10 years,  not 27,” Foster said in a recent email. “I was
    not found guilty of the indictment, but the judge abused her authority and said
    she believed I was selling drugs.”\n\nFoster continues to appeal his sentencing.
    His case is working its way through the courts. Recent changes in sentencing could
    also work to lessen his time.\n\nHe gets involved in various programs to stay
    busy and keep working on his own personal improvement. He is determined to win
    his release and get back to his family, he says. He hopes to someday combine his
    love of music and desire to help kids in a something that will help others avoid
    the mistakes he’s made.\n\n“The most important thing I want society to know is
    that the U.S. guidelines are unconstitutional and need to be fixed,” he wrote.
    “There are a lot of people locked up with all these enhancements they put on people
    for crimes they already served.”\n\nPeople make mistakes. Some get caught up in
    addiction. They are rolled up into the federal dragnet, the failed War on Drugs,
    that turns their addiction into a crime. Soon they are labeled “kingpins” and
    other phrases that aren’t the truth. Soon they are given decades in prison instead
    of lesser sentences with incentives to build a new life and overcome past mistakes.\n\nIn
    closing, many might wonder, “What does this have to do with me?”\n\nMy answer:
    It has everything to do with you. No one is immune.\n\nYoung women like Keyonna
    and my daughter are hurting without a father in the home to guide them to make
    right choices in men and life. Homes need fathers to bring the balance, many households
    are lacking without a male role model. Fathers bring laughter and so much more;
    daughters are called, “daddy’s little girls” for a reason. Homes break down, society
    suffers and the cost of incarceration rises to its staggering total of more than
    $54 billion a year. Everyone bears the costs of excessive mandatory minimum sentencing.\n\nBased
    on February 2015 Bureau of Prisons statistics more than 38,000 inmates between
    the ages of 31-35 are incarcerated in the federal bureau of prisons and another
    31,000 between the ages of 41-45!\n\nThe current federal prison population exceeds
    218,000 and it is set to increase. The annual cost to house one inmate daily in
    a low security unit is $25,378. This is per inmate.\n\nNow, who do you think foots
    this bill? Us. American tax payers. Prisons area big wealthy business; our government
    knows this and allows unjust sentencing.\n\nIt’s a shame families, daughters,
    sons, mothers, wives, husbands, and friends must suffer because of mandatory minimum
    sentencing. It’s an unjust, unfair sentencing law that needs to be done away with.\n\nOur
    prisons are overcrowded; this puts guards and inmates at risk. The crime by no
    means is fitting the time!\n\nAs Americans, we need to open our eyes and be proactive
    in this fight. We need to stay involved in sentencing reform hearings and support
    Smarter Sentencing Acts and Reforms. Petitions for bringing back federal parole
    are in the works. The political will to reform these lengthy laws exists now,
    and both parties want solutions.\n\nYour voice of support can make a huge difference.
    You can send a quick letter to your Congressional leaders saying you support mandatory
    minimum sentencing reform.\n\nIf child molesters can get parole, why shouldn’t
    nonviolent drug offenders? I will keep writing and informing so we can all do
    our part a much needed part to help make a difference for the Keyonnas, Kierras,
    Brians and Kevins all over the world caught up in a broken system we call justice.
    We are seeing it is not Just-ice…it’s just ICE…ice cold and cruel."

  title: Life sometimes needs more than second chances
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I wonder where who decided that two is the magic number when it comes to screw ups? Who said “second chances” were such a special gift?

    I wonder because the longer I hang around this thing called life the more I see the vast majority of people having blasted way past two chances when it comes to living the best life we can. Seriously, if your life played like a movie on the big screen in full honesty for all to see would you need just “two” chances?

    I find it interesting that Jesus of all people pointed out our collective hypocrisy. How many times should we forgive, he is asked? The rule at that time in first century Judiasm was apparently seven. (Gosh, would seven chances be nice now in this day and age of “second chances” being such a gift?). Jesus said it wasn’t near enough. “Seven times seventy times,” he said.

    Now that sounds a lot more like it to me. God knows I’ve needed more than my fair share under any other calculus of chances.

    I write this today because a friend of mine is starting his new life, having walked out of prison yesterday. He is determined to make the most of this opportunity. He just finished a six-month intensive treatment program to deal with criminality and addiction. He talks like a new man. I know him well enough to know how sincere he is. As I spoke with him, I got a clear sense that he isn’t talking about “second chances.” He is talking about his “last chance.” He knows he’s done the prison thing too long. He knows his record is too deep. He knows he has long since burned through most of the chances life has afforded him.

    But miraculously, he has another chance. He seems well poised to succeed.

    Will he?

    Who knows? The odds makers would bet against him. All I know is I like his chances, whatever number this is.

    I also know the sooner we stop talking about second chances, as if there were people out there still living high on their first chance, the more we will become the people of grace and kindness that can help redeem the millions of who we as a society have thrown away into human warehouses, labeled as “inmates” and somehow decided that they are out of chances this life has offered them.

    My friend gets another chance today to start anew.

    And that, in my opinion, makes it a very good day.

  title: 'Rule 4: Choose to survive well'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    When the bars of prison rack loudly behind you, the stubborn immutability of the situation settles on your mind like dense fog.

    For the first time in my life I couldn’t change my life’s course. I couldn’t decide where I wanted to live or who I wanted to live with. I couldn’t choose a new job. I couldn’t flee if danger arose, which inevitably it did. Locked in a cage surrounded by a fence, topped with barbed wire and surrounded further by walls guarded by people with guns, I realized how far I had fallen. I was powerless, or so I thought.

    Then my dear cousin wrote me and said simply, “Choose to survive well.”

    Suddenly the dark fog relented. Even amid all the powerlessness, a choice remained. I could survive, but I could also choose to survive well. So I did.

    That choice opened a sea of possibility in an otherwise choiceless place. I discovered yoga and meditation, gifts I still enjoy. I honed my craft as a writer, penning thousands of pages on lined paper in barely legible scrawl. I wrote letters and worked to rebuild relationships strained by my alcoholism and criminal behavior. I got sober. And these just scratch the surface of the choices I made to survive well.

    I think Gandhi said this first. Who knows? It’s so basic, so fundamental it needs little explanation, especially when viewed in the reality of rule 1 that life is messy. We can’t avoid hardship. We create much of it, but even a careful, examined and considerate approach to life does not exempt us from suffering. Disease comes. Disaster occurs. Accidents happen no matter how much our society remains addicted to blame, as if every event deserves some type of justice and every difficulty results in compensation. The reason America is crushed by the weight of its own litigious actions flows from its collective refusal to accept the difficulties of life.

    Don’t sue. Don’t seek revenge. Don’t give into bitterness or hate. These only consume you, not the God who allows a tornado, or the frenemy who steals your girl. Instead seek your center. Find your anchor amid the storm. Choose to survive well. When clear skies and calm waters return to your life, when you feel your good fortune come back around as it often does, you’ll be healthy enough to enjoy it.

    The key word is choice. We control so little in life. But we retain the power to choose. As Frost says, there are two roads. Choose the one less traveled, as that makes all the difference.

  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Antonio Yarbough spent the first two days of freedom largely at a loss for words. But the three words he said quietly over the phone in the hours immediately following his exoneration for the 1992 murder of his mother, his sister and a family friend, spoke volumes about the man’s character and faith.

    “God is just,” he said.

    “Just” is the root of the word of justice, which arrived for 39-year-old Yarbough 22 years late on Feb. 6. That’s when a Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice found Yarbough and his co-defendant, Sharrif Wilson, 37, innocent.

    Once freed and the injustice reversed, Yarbough was repeatedly asked how it felt. Leaving the courtroom the first day; then facing TV cameras the next day, he remained pretty much at a loss for words.

    By the third day he still struggled to grasp the changes in his life. But, it was the first day he said he could relax, hanging out with his closest friend, Eric Barden.

    “I’m just trying to figure it all out. I was 17 when this happened. Everything is so big out here,” Yarbough said. “I’m still finding my bearings, you know what I’m saying? I didn’t think about it until I got out. I have no place to stay. I have no bank account. It’s extremely weird.”

    “But I got him,” Barden said, who helped Yarbough find a temporary place to stay with his own family.

    While bitterness at the injustice would be normal, Yarbough has steadfastly clung to his faith over the last several years through the emotional ups and downs of hope rising and falling and the courts dragging on despite significant evidence that pointed to both men’s innocence.

    In September, Yarbough wrote a few friends that he hoped he’d be released any day, admitting fear that he had nowhere to go. As Christmas approached another trial date loomed. Another missed opportunity passed. Yarbough spent another Christmas in Attica. He wrote friends about a Jan. 7 hearing, asking for prayers.

    “God is good,” he wrote.

    The court again refused his release.  Then finally, the day of justice arrived.

    “Tony is a great client because he is honest with me and communicative and was always realistic despite horrendous circumstances,” defense attorney Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma said in an interview following the court decision.

    ### An era under scrutiny

    Police conduct in Brooklyn during the precise time of Yarbough and Wilson’s conviction has come under intense scrutiny in the past year. Yarbough is not the first to win long-awaited freedom. In March 2013, David Ranta, 58, was freed after serving 22 years for a murder he steadfastly claimed he did not commit.

    In May the Brooklyn district attorney’s office ordered a review of more than 50 murder cases, all assigned to retired Det. Louis Scarcella. By reopening the case court officials recognized the growing suspicion of the detective’s tactics during the time of the 1980s and 1990s when Scarcella was a celebrated homicide detective. But as Yarbough’s case shows, spurious convictions were rampant in the department and went far beyond one rogue detective.

    Yarbough and Wilson had been unjustly convicted when they were teens, caught in the grist of a police machine with a reputation of acting with impunity. Exactly how many innocent people remain unjustly incarcerated is unclear. The investigation continues.

    On June 18, 1992 Yarbough, then 18, and Wilson went to the West Village in Manhattan. They returned home to Coney Island in the morning. Yarbough entered his house and saw a grisly murder scene. All three victims had been stabbed multiple times and strangled with an electrical cord. Yarbough said he ran screaming from the house yelling, “They’re all dead.”

    He found his uncle. Together they called the police.

    The conviction of Yarbough, who had no criminal record, was based entirely on the forced confession of the then 15-year-old Wilson, a confession Wilson later recanted in writing.

    “Right now I don’t know where to start. Cuz I’m confused. Let me clear your mind. We are innocent. We never did anything,” Wilson wrote in 2005, recanting his testimony against Yarbough. “Yes I did turn state’s evidence on (Yarbough) not to hurt him. But for one I was 15 years old and scared… My lawyer kept telling me that if I didn’t do (it), Tony would do it for me.”

    The officers sought no other suspects or no other clues. They hammered the teens for a confession.

    “They solved a triple murder in one day,” Yarbough said, reflecting back. “They didn’t have a motive. They still can’t say why they only wanted us.”

    “I was tired as was Tony. The police told me that if I said Tony did it they would let me go. Stupid me, I said OK,” Wilson wrote.

    Yarbough’s first trial ended in a mistrial. The second trial he lost after Wilson’s taped confession was shown.

    Yarbough was sentenced to 75-years-to-life and sent to the notorious Super Max prison at Attica. Yarbough’s faint hope for exoneration languished for nearly 20 years until Margulis-Ohnuma agreed to take on his case pro bono. Margulis-Ohnuma is a prominent New York defense attorney.  As a member of the Criminal Justice Act he volunteered his services for those who can’t afford an attorney. Yarbough was one of these cases.

    “I got involved in the case when Tony's Attica bunkmate, Eric Barden, came to see me in 2008 and told me about it. I was moved to take it on because the circumstances overwhelmingly suggested innocence and there was no proof of guilt except the confessions,” Margulis-Ohnuma said.

    Initial attempts to reopen Yarbough’s case in 2010 failed, but the district attorney’s office agreed to test DNA evidence. DNA discovered under the nails of Yarbough’s mother linked to an unsolved murder case committed in 1999 when Yarbough was already in custody.

    The legal process for exoneration ramped up but dragged on for Yarbough, who repeatedly went back to court, each day hoping for his freedom. Finally, the day of justice arrived.

    “The day they were released was the culmination of five years of work that was, until recently, pretty thankless,” Margulis-Ohnuma said. “But I happen to love law and legal analysis, so it would always be worth doing no matter what the outcome. I have gotten five years’ worth of thanks and compliments in the last 48 hours, and I could not be happier.”

    After a celebration with Margulis-Ohnuma and friends, Yarbough went with his friend Barden to get some basic supplies.

    “I’m buying me some sneakers right now,” he said over the phone. “But I’ll have a phone tomorrow.”

    It would be the first phone number he could call his own. Later that night he went on CNN with Piers Morgan still at a loss for words.

    “What was the first thing you wanted when you got out,” Morgan asked him.

    “New York air,” he said.

    ### Rediscovering life among the living

    Over the last two years as Yarbough’s hopes for exoneration grew, he began to prepare for life on the outside. He worked toward his GED and wrote letters to several people who had heard about his case and offered support.

    Among those was Al Sloan a California man in his 80s who had heard about Yarbough through a friend of a friend. Sloan sends postcards of encouragement to a dozen or so people every week. He began writing Yarbough in 2011. Yarbough wrote him back. The pair grew close. Sloan encouraged Yarbough to prepare for his release.

    When Sloan heard Yarbough was free, he breathed a sigh of relief. Still, his concern remains.

    “That young man has so many obstacles ahead of him. The state of New York put him in prison. They need to ensure he gets on his feet now,” Sloan said.

    Yarbough left prison with about $80 and his meager belongings.

    “Right now he needs housing and a job,” Margulis-Ohnuma said in an email.

    The attorney has been taking donations for Yarbough through his personal Paypal account. The obstacles facing the man who turns 40 on Valentine’s Day are tremendous, his attorney said. Most programs in New York are geared to offenders, not innocent men.

    Eventually, Margulis-Ohnuma believes, both men will be compensated by the state of New York.

    “In the meantime they desperately need moral, spiritual and financial support to recover from the 7,903 days that were taken from them and, in Tony’s case, from the vicious massacre of his family,” Margulis-Ohnuma said.

    Yarbough said he still hasn’t been allowed to grieve the death of his family. He didn’t know where his mother and sister were buried.

    All in good time, he said. Still it was prominent on his mind to be grateful: “Tell everyone I said thanks man. I’m blessed.”

  title: JLUSA sets ambitious goal for decarceration
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    We ran into Glenn Martin in the cyber-world attracted like a magnet by the power of his message. Martin is like that Dr. Pepper commercial that talks about being uniquely one. After getting educated at Criminal U, Martin defied the odds to find both success and influence as an innovator, entrepreneur and activist for reform.

    He started his latest organization, JustLeadershipUSA, four months ago with a serious launch set for November. The goal is equally serious: To reduce the number of people in prison by half by the year 2030 through a strategy of federal and state-specific decarceration campaigns.

    We caught him for about 15 minutes at the end of his jam-packed 15 hour day. Of course the first thing we wanted to know — what we always want to know with former inmates — is how: How did he make the transition from inmate to the leader he is now.

    “For me it started on the inside,” he said. “The truth is once I ended up in prison, I was immediately taken aback at the hypocrisy in the system.”

    He spoke of common experiences we’ve all shared, like a so-called “liaison” committee that was stacked with college graduates who quickly became infuriated at the patronizing and impossible situation of trying to improve the prison inside. Been there, done that, I thought.

    “Most ended up thrown in the box,” he said.

    Yep, yep, can relate to that, for sure. I was once banned from Yoga for a month because I was accused of organizing a threat group. Those were the days…
    Martin became a paralegal, one of the few opportunities afforded inmates to learn something beyond menial labor.

    “This was an important part of my career because it connected with me others coming out of the system,” he said.

    Once out, he got to work, working his way up through the ladder of various organizations dedicated to impacting the massive state of incarceration.

    He learned the practical problems with ambitious goals within a system designed to grind those inside and those working outside to dust. Many in his line of work suffer from “fatigue,” he said, which is precisely why JustLeadershipUSA is launching with such an ambitious goal.

    “People have carved out the battles that they are willing to fight and a lot of them are very mediocre,” he said. They focus too much  on re-entry. It’s like saying I’m going to solve cancer and end up building emergency rooms.”

    Of central focus to Martin’s new organization is working inside to build leaders.

    “One of the big things missing in the field is that we have not done a good job of investing in the leadership capacity of those who have been arrested,” he said. “We have not done a good job of building a base.”

    Martin has spent a lot of years learning that those in power, the legislatures, the corrections officials, even many of the activists, “have little appetite for risk.”

    The latest example: President Barack Obama, who is making historic changes in sentencing, but is doing so very, very carefully. Martin said the president is looking for “perfect people” to grant clemency.

    “I appreciate the fact that he’s saying it, but because we are not having enough conversation about this system and how this system doesn’t work… we’re going to end up with what I define is marginal change,” Martin said.

    Martin also is not sold that the argument is purely economic. While the conservatives have suddenly switched from lock ’em up and throw away the key to prison reform solely on economic terms, Martin says the moral imperative remains the stronger, more courageous argument.

    “How far are we willing to go?” he asks. “It’s always the moral argument that ends up toward the tipping point, not the financial argument. It’s a good argument and I wouldn’t want to lose it, but its not the main point.”

    Martin says the time for The Tipping Point is fast approaching, acknowledging both left and right agree on many of the issues of criminal justice reform.

    “It’s the one thing they seem to have some bipartisan support for,” he said. “But it would be a lost opportunity for The Left not to realize the moral issue that can be capitalized on.”

    Will they risk it, he wonders? So far, the political risk takers are hard to find.

    Speaking of risk takers, Martin practices what he preaches. He’s not just pointing fingers, he’s launching an organization from the ground up in true entrepreneurial spirit.

    “The reason I feel more entrepreneurial now,” say the man whose title is Chief Risk Taker, “… I really did lead with the intent of building the wings on the way down and it takes a certain appetite for risk to do that. That’s an entrepreneur.”

    He says every experience dating back to his prison job as a paralegal has helped train him for this venture. Rather than shy from those things that felt foreign — like policy, he said that he had to learn in his first post-prison jobs — he dove in and learned.

    This more than anything else may explain his current success. So many inmates are confined in coffins of insecurity they made for themselves out of fear that someone might discover how little they actually know. Bullshit is far too often the coin of the realm in Criminal U. But for those like Martin willing to learn, the potential is significant.

    “There’s not much of a difference of the guy on Wall Street who takes a risk with a billion dollars and the guy in the hood who sees selling crack cocaine as the way to get out,” Martin said. “One is defined as legal and one is not and that makes the difference.”

    Recognizing that difference and impacting it with leadership skills is Martin’s focus. Shaping the skills within the inmate population that exists and directing it toward legal pursuits not only takes an inmate out of the cell, but conceivably empowers them to be like Martin, a job creator willing to reach back in his life to a painful past and help others along the way.

    But Martin also wants to change the argument that for too long has focused entirely on the disproportionate incarceration of blacks. He’s one of them. He’s been there. He knows its true. But the mass epidemic of incarceration has impacted far more than blacks. It has touched families all across America from every walk of life. That’s the way industrialized prison economies work, they don’t discriminate in their need for human fuel to keep the gears of the machine churning. When a privatized prison operator puts a clause in a contract that forces the state to guarantee 90 percent occupancy — which has happened — that state isn’t going to stop with locking up only blacks.

    “Disproportionate is the oldest argument and it’s a weak argument that gets no traction, and I’m a black man saying it,” Martin said. “We need to talk about how it impacts families. And other issues. It’s a lost opportunity.”

    Martin said people don’t understand that we have hundreds of thousands of  people coming home from prisons each year. The impact on communities is enormous and yet too often ignored.

    But it won’t be for long if Martin can figure out how to build the wings of his new organization as it descends toward its November landing.

    For those interested in joining the effort, Martin directs them to consider becoming a member.

    “We’re looking to create the largest and most diverse network dedicated to criminal justice reform in the country,” he said.

    Help him reach the goal. Follow him at #halfby2030 campaign.

    And stay tuned for November.

  title: Prisoners of Age shows power of story
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Floor-to-ceiling photos on display and paired with a simple,
    clear story told in the subject of the photo’s own words make up an important
    exhibit called [Prisoners of Age](http://www.prisonersofage.com/exhibitions_san-francisco).\n\nThe
    exhibit accomplishes many things like humanizes those behind bars, highlights
    a growing health crisis, raises the issue of life sentences and activates a discussion
    of what “justice” really entails. But more than anything it exemplifies the transformational
    power of story.\n\nYou see these faces and it begs for attention. A quote in the
    exhibit from a prison warden captures the mood: Just what are we doing here? \n\nThe
    photography is brilliant in its simplicity. Inmates in their environments. All
    old. All profoundly human. The short captions that accompany them show the artist’s
    commitment to honest storytelling, both in photo and word. There is no whitewashing
    these people, as the Prisoners of Age website explains:\n\n“The portraits in the
    ‘Prisoners of Age’ exhibition are immense [4’x8′], graphic and command the viewer’s
    attention. The full exhibition comprises 60 4×8 ft prints, vertically suspended
    from the museum ceilings. All prints include text from interviews with inmates
    and corrections personnel. It’s hard to imagine these old men as criminals running
    from the law. You see the frailty, the forgetfulness, the universal problems of
    old age apparent in generations of your own family. Many of their stories are
    those that ring true today about fits of anger, rage, foolish steps they took
    in their youth that brought them to where they are now. Others are remorseless.
    ‘Prisoners of Age’ seeks a balance of the two dispositions, through images and
    text, lending insight into the lawbreaker’s proclivity to commit crime.”\n\nPrisoners
    of Age are just one more subset of a larger problem. Locking up more and more
    people for longer and longer periods of time hasn’t worked. Solutions are harder
    to come by, and perhaps worthy of healthy debate.\n\nWhat can’t be debated is
    the humanity in those faces. Despite all they’ve been through, they remain, profoundly
    human. As such, we are obligated to ask again, just what are we doing here?\n\n*The
    Prisoners of Age exhibit is now on display at Alcatraz in San Francisco. *"

  title: 'Homeless: a crime to have no place to go'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    “Move along.”

    Police tell homeless people these words countless times a day in the liberal “sanctuary city” of San Francisco.

    But the 6,000 homeless people have fewer and fewer places to move along to. Homeless advocates say punishing the poor through criminalization continues to rise. In short, there is precious little sanctuary left in the city named after St. Francis of Assisi, Saint of the poor.

    “At a time of drastic cuts to mental health, criminalization increased from 2009-2012,” a report by the Coalition on Homelessness stated.

    The targeted legislation increases the criminalization leading to more citations, more arrests, loss of meager assets and ineligibility for social programs.

    Let’s take a hypothetical. The various stages of it happen every day.
    With escalating rates, a landlord evicts a lower class tenant–let’s call her Sarah and give her a young child as well–so they can raise the rates. Sarah trades her car for a van and moves into it. She tries to keep her job.

    But five times in recent years the city’s transit authority has passed legislation limiting where vehicles can park. No large vehicles are allowed in industrial areas, so Sarah is cited in the middle of the night. She moves. It happens again. Police impound her vehicle. She loses her job because of coming in late and calling in sick.

    She gives her daughter to a relative living somewhere else, and she takes to the streets. Her apartment, which became a van, is now a sleeping bag.

    She finds a few people who treat her kindly. They offer protection from the rampant sexual violence a homeless woman faces.

    Consider that sexual violence against homeless women has been reported as high as 90 percent. The fear she will experience is gripping.

    Many are already traumatized when they come to the streets as domestic violence is a primary cause (as high as 40 percent) for homelessness of women and children. That trauma and violence will likely continue.

    So Sarah’s safety is short lived. One night, while camped out, police arrive and arrest them all. They end up locked up for seven hours, processed and released. It’s not light yet. But Sarah’s sleeping bag is now evidence. She leaves cold and with nothing. She goes to the BART stop at Civic Station that is near the jail. She falls asleep in a corner where it’s slightly warm. When the morning commute begins, she is taken into custody by BART police.

    “It’s not OK to cite, jail and arrest people who are too poor to have a place to live. We are doing that right now. The BART police are doing that. They are not processed, but they spend about 12 hours in jail. They are put in handcuffs… This is awful,” said Jennifer Freidenbach, executive director of the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness, a few months ago in a public speech.

    This story is hypothetical, but it also closely mirrors that which happened to Julia Chang, a single mother who defied the odds by not only getting back into stable housing but housing in San Francisco. She is one of only 30 percent who lose their homes who find a way to stay in “sanctuary city.”

    “I became homeless largely due to domestic violence, and I was pregnant at the time. I had no idea how people look at you, judging you every day,” she said in a public speaking engagement.

    She slept in BART, “because it’s warmer.” She was arrested more than once for looking like she was asleep, she says.

    The officer arrested me for “intent to sleep.”

    Chang said one of the city laws prohibits lodging and items you need for lodging. If you’re sleeping on cardboard, they’ll confiscate the cardboard. Same goes with the sleeping bag.

    “Dogs have better rights on the street than homeless because they can lie down, they can urinate,” Chang said.

    Chang said she felt hated when she was homeless. But many believe hatred doesn’t fuel the criminalization. Hopelessness does. San Francisco has been in a time of financial boom unlike anything since the Gold Rush. But while many have grown richer, the marginalized have been priced up. Homelessness has increased. The trash on the streets, the perpetual smell of urine, the debris from those with no place to go has also increased. We assume we can’t solve homelessness because it can’t be solved.

    This is the biggest lie of them all.

    “We can solve this problem because we created this problem through some very poorly thought out policy decisions,” Freidenbach said.

    Rapid cuts in the 1980s removed the safety net that had been in place since the New Deal.

    “We never addressed that systemic cause. We never repaired our social safety net. So over time the local governments had this burden of homelessness. So they turned to the police, which led to the massive incarceration of the homeless that continues today,” Freidenbach said.

    If we believe homeless can’t be solved, than incarceration seems viable, so much so that San Francisco’s jail is the city’s largest housing facility for the homeless, according to a recent report.

    But we know better. We know it’s a matter of will. Global poverty is diminishing. The United Nations has set a goal to eliminate poverty by 2030. Modern innovations and the wealth created means we have unlimited potential to solve homelessness right here. More so, we have an obligation as a society to solve it. Because after all, we created it in the first place.

  title: Les Bower execution delayed by Supreme Court
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Death Row inmate Les Bower has again received a late hour
    stay of execution, this time from the highest court in the land.\n\n“This morning
    the Supreme Court granted our request for a stay pending consideration of our
    Writ of Cert,” one of Bower’s attorneys, James Glenn, wrote in an email this morning.\n\nBower
    was set to be executed on Feb. 10 by the state of Texas. He has previously had
    at least five stays. He has been on Death Row for more than thirty years. Had
    the Supreme Court not stepped in he would have been the oldest man ever executed
    in Texas. He is 67 years old.\n\nRecently, [Execution Watch](http://www.executionwatch.org/)
    radio host and well-known advocate for inmates, Ray Hill, visited with Bower to
    record an interview that would have played on Hill’s show prior to Bower’s execution.\n\n“Lester
    and I are old friends,” Hill said. “He’s the dean on death row, and the trouble
    is the case is entirely circumstantial. With a circumstantial case you can never
    be entirely sure of guilt.”\n\nWhich is precisely the reason why Bower, who has
    maintained his innocence all along, has received so many stays of execution. When
    there is any doubt, the state has the obligation to delay. With Bower, as Hill
    stated, the case is circumstantial.\n\nBower is accused of an execution-style
    murder of four men in 1983. He had purchased a $4,000 plane from one of the victims,
    which police believe to be the motive of the killings. One report said they believe
    he simply “snapped.” Parts of the plane were found in Bower’s possession and he
    initially lied to the FBI and his wife about having bought it.\n\nBut as Glenn
    said in an email to Criminal U sent earlier this week, evidence that is crucial
    to the case still hasn’t been properly considered.\n\n“There were hairs found
    at the scene that do not come from Les or the victims,” Glenn wrote in an email.
    “We have been trying, unsuccessfully, for several years now to identify who they
    came from, as they may be traceable to the men we believe committed the crimes.”\n\nSeveral
    years after Bower was convicted, [a woman came forward](http://stopexecutions.blogspot.com/2008/07/witness-says-lester-bower-is-innocent.html)
    and claimed he couldn’t have committed the murders. She said she knew the killers,
    a group of men involved in a drug deal gone bad. But the state questioned the
    credibility of her statement and Bower has remained in prison.\n\n“Bower’s lawyers
    say they have identified the four men whom (the woman) alleges to be the killers,
    have documented their long criminal records and have confirmed other key parts
    of her story,” The Fort-Worth Star Telegram reported as an earlier execution date
    for Bower approached.\n\nGlenn said simply commuting Bower’s sentence to a life
    sentence would be a huge step of justice even while continuing the push for exoneration.\n\n“While
    most vocal advocates for Les tend to be anti-death-penalty, many of those most
    troubled by this case are in fact strong defenders of the death penalty,” Glenn
    wrote. “The key component of a pro-death-penalty position is that it has to be
    used wisely, as Gov. Perry indicated in his “smart on crime” comments.  To hold
    a pro-death-penalty position, it is imperative to be certain that everyone who
    receives the death penalty be unquestionably guilty of the crimes of which they
    have been convicted.”\n\n“Unquestionably guilty” simply doesn’t apply to Les Bower.
    Glenn encourages everyone associated with the final decision to execute Bower
    or not to consider these “unassailable” facts:\n1.\tMr. Bower had no criminal
    record prior to his conviction.\n2.\tThe case against Mr. Bower was entirely circumstantial.\n3.\tThe
    prosecution relied on a forensic fact (that the type of ammunition used to commit
    the crime had been in Mr. Bower’s possession), that it knew could not be proven.\n4.\tThe
    prosecution relied on a fact – that the ammunition was very rare – it knew to
    be untrue.\n5.\tThe gun the prosecution claimed Mr. Bower used to commit the crimes
    could not have been the murder weapon.\n6.\tSince his conviction, multiple witnesses,
    with no previous connection to Mr. Bower at all, have come forward specifically
    identifying another group of individuals they testify confessed to committing
    the crime.\n7.\tIn the 30 years Mr. Bower has been in jail, he has been a model
    prisoner with no incidents of violence, and seems to pose no threat to other inmates
    or correction officers.\n8.\tMr. Bower remains married to the same woman he was
    on the day he was convicted, and is a grandfather approaching the age of 70 –
    he seems to pose no threat to society at large.\n9.\tMr. Bower has steadfastly
    maintained his innocence for 30 years.\n\n“Whether or not the above proves Mr.
    Bower is unquestionably innocent, it at least proves that there more than a reasonable
    doubt that he is guilty,” Glenn wrote.\n\nThe fight continues. The Supreme Court
    will now consider its next steps. The state could still step in and heed the appeal
    with more than 225 letters sent on Bower’s behalf, according to his wife Shari.
    \ How long the execution is delayed or whether it will be commuted to life in
    prison remains to be seen.\n\n“Victims deserve justice, and so do their families,”
    Glenn wrote. ” But commuting Mr. Bower’s  sentence doesn’t  deprive anyone of
    justice being served.  Commutation means that Mr. Bower will remain in prison
    for the rest of his life.   But commutation also means that eliminating the risk
    of executing a man who may have been wrongly convicted.”\n\nWhether the DNA from
    the crime scene will ever be tested remains a serious concern as does the amount
    of evidence that has come forward after Bower was found guilty.\n\n“The catastrophic
    nature of finding additional evidence that he was innocent after the punishment
    cannot be overstated,” Glenn wrote.\n\nJustice remains undone. The one thing that
    is certain is this: doubt. And for that reason alone the push to execute Les Bower
    must end so that the next critical question, that of innocence, can properly be
    determined. A man who had never before committed a crime has been in prison for
    three decades. That error, if indeed it is proven to be an error, cannot be undone
    or ever truly compensated. But what remains of Bower’s life, to his wife and daughters,
    these remaining years could be the most precious of all. The real killers DNA
    could be examined. Justice can still, even after decades of possible injustice,
    be served."

    Since B.B. King passed away, worthy tributes have abounded. The great artist’s unique talent lives on. The blues are B.B. King and B.B. King is the blues.

    But so do his contributions, especially one he called one of the greatest performances he ever gave, a visit to the notorious maximum security Sing Sing prison on Thanksgiving Day, 1972.

    He chose to spend Thanksgiving inside to enrich those who so rarely are: “Such a work of grace and connection,” a pastor friend of mine said when he sent me the link.

    King did connect. He treated the men like men, joking with them just as he might have done in a barber shop or at a bar after a concert.

    “Quite a few of you dudes have the blues already,” he said to roars of approval.

    King was joined by Joan Baez and was introduced by sit-com star Jimmie Walker.

    I’ve spent some bleak Thanksgiving Days in prison. This was one every inmate and all those who attended would surely remember as something to be very thankful for.

    “There was a riot at Sing Sing prison, but it was a riot of music, emotion, enthusiasm and good feelings. What a day. What a concert!” wrote Jerry Oster of the New York Daily News.

    King lived a long, talented artistic life. This is one gift he gave that will long live on.

  title: Solutions that don’t disrupt aren’t solutions at all
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Last week The Brennan Center for Justice released [a 164-page
    downloadable publication](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/solutions-american-leaders-speak-out-criminal-justice)
    called *Solutions: America’s leaders speak out on criminal justice*.\n\nThe list
    of contributors is indeed a who’s who of political leaders including most of the
    biggest names running or rumored to be running for president in 2016: Joe Biden,
    Hillary Clinton, Rand Paul, Rick Perry, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie
    and Martin O’Malley. Nearly 18 months ago we started writing about a fast approaching
    tipping point in criminal justice reform that would culminate with this issue
    as the key point of bipartisan agreement in 2016.\n\nTa da!\n\nIt didn’t take
    a crystal ball.  Even though the political will for change didn’t exist in 2012,
    according the New York Times, the unsustainable nature of the epidemic of mass
    incarceration forced these legislators’ hands. The billion-dollar boondoggle that
    is our prison system can’t sustain its current pace of incarceration and recidivism,
    which may explain why polar political opposites, George Soros and The Koch Brothers
    have committed hundreds of millions of dollars toward solutions.\n\nBut the solutions
    offered so far fail to accomplish the single most essential need for genuine reform.
    They fail to disrupt the cycle of crime that sustains the epidemic. Without disrupting
    the school-to-prison pipeline flow that begins with increasing police presences
    on school campuses, reform won’t stop the tide of incarceration. Without disrupting
    stagnant recidivism rates, all the early releases and sentencing reductions in
    the world won’t reform the system. The revolving door will just spin faster.\n\nI
    offer a simple starting point: Those who played such a significant role in the
    criminalization of this country (i.e., any political leader in office over the
    past 30 years) should not be called on to fix the problem they created. At the
    very least they should admit their role in the epidemic of incarceration as a
    precursor to involvement.\n\nSo isn’t it telling that the Foreword on this significant
    new publication is authored by former President Bill Clinton, who along with former
    President Ronald Reagan’s War on Drugs, is most responsible for the system as
    it exists now? President Clinton remains, in my opinion, the most effective president
    in a generation, but without recognizing part of that efficacy resulted in the
    construction of a billion-dollar a year culture of criminalization, any thoughts
    he offers now are rendered meaningless.\n\nWe’ve glimpsed what the coming “Era
    of Enlightenment” might bring as politicians offer “solutions” for a problem they
    refuse to acknowledge exists. These “solutions” will take the energy out of the
    reform movement, by casting crumbs to poster children of reform, but failing to
    assess the systemic problems. They will treat symptoms but never seek a cure.
    They are akin to the tobacco industry quietly funding anti-smoking campaigns to
    shift the attention away from its basic desire to conduct business as usual.\n\nThe
    corrections system in this country is a stubborn behemoth. It is wired to resist
    change and avoid transparency and accountability at all costs. It is built on
    these principles with a culture that is cemented in bedrock. All the talk in the
    world won’t reform this system, but it could well sap the energy for reform that
    has emerged with nominal solutions and “fixes” the established structure will
    tolerate. And why not? Those who built the structure now seek to reform it.\nReality
    Check:\n1.\tReform will only come through innovation powerful enough to disrupt
    how we view crime, criminals and justice.\n2.\tInnovation solutions must start
    with disrupting the existing cycles and the culture of criminal justice embedded
    in our institutions.\n3.\tReform requires new thinking that confronts our need
    to villanize and dehumanize.\n4.\tReform must turn criminals into citizens, prisons
    into incubators and convicts into CEOs with a value placed on humanity and corrections
    that focuses on restorative justice for both victim and perpetrator.\n5.\tReform
    must utilize the vast talent and experience of those who have been subject to
    the system itself.\n\nA Criminal U reunion conference that puts the politicians
    on equal footing with the alumni working in truth of our collective contribution
    to the problem is a vital first step of reform. All this other action, talk and
    energy is mere prologue. The fear is we will be convinced that this is the reform
    we need and thus never accept the responsibility of our past mistakes and an honest
    look at what is needed in the future.\nThis dire situation requires better. But
    will we have the heart to find real, rather than political, solutions?"

  title: 'Rule #1: Life is really freaking messy (Don’t play God)'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Life is messy… really $(%#ing messy if you ask me. More delicate ways to say the same thing have existed for as long as humans have pondered their great purpose in life. The Buddhists have a series of “greatest truths.” One claims simply, “Life is difficult.” A favorite of mine, M. Scott Peck, started his book *The Road Less Traveled* by saying that life is difficult, but only when one realizes it is difficult, does it cease to be so. This does strike me as a great truth. To capture the whole idea I simplified it by calling it what it is: a freakin’ mess.

    This starts this whole idea of how to live life, because I think it’s a lens to view the rest of it. Without this lens, life can be really distorted. But, as important as this concept is, it doesn’t work well as the first rule. This is a statement of fact, not a real rule. So the real rule here, the rule that stems from this fact is simple: Don’t play God. Don’t try to always clean up the mess.

    Let’s pause for a moment and think this through. Most of the time when people say, “don’t play God!” they are reacting against a power struggle of some sort. They are angry, threatened or scared — or all of the above — and they see another person as the source of that fear. So it’s telling when they say “don’t play God,” or some variation of that theme. We often envision God as something like that — threatening, mercurial, a wisp of a shadow or a figment of our imagination that scares the shit out of us.

    But I don’t write this rule for folks suffering delusional, sadistic power complexes. Let’s face it, those folks aren’t reading this book. No, this rule is more ordinary, more human, more common. We all play God to some extent, and we do it largely when our lives spin out of control. We react to the instability by groping for order. We freak out and want all the mess cleaned up. There’s nothing maniacal about this, but it can make you and those around you pretty miserable. So life is messy… face it… and don’t play God. That’s the rule here.

    For a lot of people just the word “messy” starts an internal sense of panic. Like a clothes dryer taking its first tumble, their stomachs roll releasing a physical jolt of anxiety that crackling through their chest. Order, control, sanitary. These are the words that stop the churning heart and douse the anxiety. But they are often as effective as an umbrella in a hurricane. It’s impossible to bring order to this wonderfully chaotic, messy, unfathomable yet beautiful life we live, because at its most basic fundamental element, life is really, really freaking messy.

    Why?

    (Shrug.) Does why matter?

    Only to the extent we want to play God. Once we admit our arrogance, the need to answer why fades. Sure, if you were God you’d organize this world. You’d clean up the mess. You’d dole out the marching orders, get the time clock working and set this thing right just as a gardener reins in the wild weeds allowed to run amok amid the glorious vegetables. Neat rows. Little signs making all things clear. Fresh tilled ground without a weed in sight. Even a white picket fence border because Lord only knows (or She should anyway) every perfect picture needs a frame. But here is the hard part: What to do with all those humans running around defiantly unwilling to get into lines?

    Psychologists refer to humans as “the ghost in the machine.” In other words, much of the universe runs like a perfectly timed Swiss watch: instinctual, predictable and measurable. Except humans. They are confoundingly unpredictable. They make messes of order. Ours is a world so organized that we can launch an unmanned space ship to intersect with Neptune a bazillion miles away from one moving, spinning starting point to another moving, spinning ending point and actually do it within a few seconds of the predicted route. That’s order. Humans can’t figure out how to make a twenty-minute commute between a home that never moves to a place of employment that never moves without being late about once every three days. That’s the ghost in the machine.

    Psychologist Rollo May summed it up another way. “Man is the strangest of all animals. He is the only one who runs faster, after he has lost his way.”

    Been there, done that. Believe that.

    Margaret Craven in her stirring little book *I Heard the Owl Call my Name* describes this phenomena this way: “Here every bird and fish knew its course. Every tree had its own place upon this earth. Only man had lost his way.”

    So here is where the whole If-I-was-God-Plan breaks down because like God you would have to bring order to this life we live with us still in it.

    Oops. Not so easy anymore.

    So we are back to where we started. Breathe in, breathe out. Let it go. Life is messy: Why? Who knows?

    There is one consolation that could help accept the reality of this messy life we live. Life is fundamentally messy because of the single most important force in the universe: love. God loves us. He wants us to love him back. The only way he could do that is to let us choose to love him. *So, out of love, he let us run wild*. And therein lays the mess. This love makes life messy. It makes it difficult. You can’t change it. But you can be free to accept people as the flawed ghost in the machine we really are. That will set your heart free to love; like a mother loves a toddler even when the little pain in the ass just smeared chocolate pudding on her face instead of in her mouth. Or just as a teen can talk for ten hours straight with his first love and not even care what else is going on in the world.

    “Love God and do as you please,” St. Augustine suggested, which sure is not as organized as the Ten Commandments, but just may be a big step forward living in harmony with this messy world rather than exhausting yourself trying to clean it up.

  title: 'Life Inside: Readying to leave behind a quarter century behind bars'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    John Michael Hamilton is one of the important characters you’ll meet in my forthcoming memoir. He is a complex man, with a unique story who I had the pleasure of meeting inside Criminal U. He first sought me out for friendship at a time I needed it.

    Four months into my sentence, a guard approached me at my job, folding laundry.

    “You’re Bolsinger?” he asked.

    “Yes.”

    “Roll up.”

    A jolt of panic hit my chest. My shoulders jerked visibly.

    “Where am I going?” I asked. I had already learned what virtually every inmate instinctively knows: Change is rarely good. Almost never good. Never easy. Never, never easy.

    “The Pen,” he said, confirming my worst fears.

    “Why?”

    He shrugged and walked away.

    Within hours I was “the new guy” in the fishbowl, a large glass room on the main floor of Oregon State Penitentiary, the state’s only maximum-security prison, home to its death row. I had been charged for a second time, financial charges my attorney had once brushed away as inconsequential. At the time he said, “They won’t amount to five days in jail.”

    Now the prosecutor was seeking 15 years, requiring my transfer to The Pen.

    At first I made my transition well. But soon, as inevitably happens with bored inmates locked in an endless cycle of hopeless, I became a target.

    I learned to walk quickly, eat carefully, trust no one and never relax. I clung to my sanity with calls home to Lori and the kids, whose unflinching love became the inspiration for my survival. I stared out the bars of my cell and wondered if this would become my “normal” for years to come.

    I set up a meeting with John, a bank robber wrapping up a 15-year set who had reached out to me in friendship. He had been looking into the smear campaign going on about me behind my back. We met out on the yard on a rainy winter afternoon.

    “You’re smarter than all these guys,” he told me. “You know all this shit. The politics—90 percent con and hustle. If they think you’re soft, they’ll never let up. They want to get paid more than they care about hurting you. Use your brains. Make it hard for them. They’ll move on to someone else.”

    I thanked John. I stuffed my hands into my pockets and pulled my wet beanie down on my head. I set my resolve to survive well. I dove into prison politics. I turned the tide against me. I survived. As John predicted, they moved on to easier prey.

    I learned later that John had sat back and watched. I needed to pass a few tests about life inside. He needed to see how I’d respond. I earned his respect. Soon without ever knowing it a group of long-time inmates put out the word only because John asked them to. He had that sway and it benefited me even when I didn’t know it.

    John helped me adapt to the state pen when I was still a raw, underclassmen – a potential target for the veterans not too dissimilar from military school hazing if you throw in the real potential for severe physical abuse and the potential for endless extortion. I would never be exposed or vulnerable again. With John’s help, I learned my lessons well.

    Three years later when I was approaching the end of my education at Criminal U, I looked across the yard at the minimum security camp where I was finishing out my set. I had reached that point that I had seen in others like John years before. I didn’t want to meet new inmates. I watched to see who would prove themselves before I wasted my time. As I looked across the yard, I saw a worn out guy looking like all sorts of hell walking and talking with another inmate in the endless circles around the yard like a kennel dog.

    He noticed me first.

    John was back and he looked the worse for wear for a man who had been given his freedom. Neither of us knew, but the roles were now reversed. I had status on this yard. John was new and had lost his physical luster. Nobody knew his reputation, a hard-earned one from the country’s most notorious prisons like Levenworth and Bloody Baumont. In more than two decades inside he had never been in a minimum prison. It was new and unfamiliar and he struggled to adapt. I returned the lesson he gave me.

    “You’re smarter than these guys,” I told him.

    Like me at OSP, John adapted. Soon he had his legs beneath him again.

    We grew close. He taught me to play the guitar better. I worked with him on his writing. We both worked in the school helping inmates earn their GEDs. But the closer I got to release, the more John concerned me. The tension between us grew. Issues rose mainly as we both looked to life outside. Would we try to connect on the outs as we said? Most inmates talk a good game, walk out the gates, and never look back to the same men they once called “brothers.” But John and I tried to be real, and the reality caused concern. For the first time I had my doubts about him. Would he truly reform and break a life of incarceration?

    Nevertheless as I walked out of the prison to freedom at 12:10 a.m. and greeted my family in the dark parking lot, a single beam from a flashlight in an upper window danced happily. I knew it was John, shooting fireworks into my freedom night sky.

    After a few weeks I started writing the guys in our little group. I saved John’s for last, which I knew would piss him off. Unlike the others, which were upbeat and friendly, I took my friend John to task.

    “Am I just a mark to you,” I asked? I called him out on all types of behaviors I had seen those last weeks that suggested John was still running his game, a game that would bring him back to prison again.

    I heard from my other friends John had taken my letter badly. Weeks went by. Finally his angry response came. He was hurt. He showed little understanding of what I was talking about. It made me think a lot about my letter and why I had written it.

    I began to understand I had to see what he’d do with his remaining nine months in prison. Would this truly be “it” for him? Or would it be the beginning of his end. Even though he was not yet 50, he’d spent half his life behind bars. If he came back again, he’d become those guys we’d seen – lifers with vacations, we’d call them. Guys who’d done way too much time and every time they got released would “vacation” by running amok until the law rounded them up. Sooner or later they’d get a long set and that would be that. With John’s past, he would get nailed to the cross if he ever got caught doing serious crime again.

    Just as John had sat back at OSP and watched me learn what I was made of, I guess I needed to sit back and learn the same about him.

    Well, months have passed and John is preparing to leave. For the first time in nearly a quarter century of incarceration he went to treatment. He has worked every day, 15 hours a day in a six-month treatment program – the same one I went through. He’d call every now and again and I could hear the change. I could sense the skin shedding from him, the layers of criminal thinking that had imprisoned him more than bars and barbed wire ever had, falling away.

    “Since the first day I went to prison, I’ve never been comfortable in my own skin,” the most experienced inmate I’ve ever met told me. “I am becoming comfortable in my own skin now.”

    Yesterday we made plans for me to pick him up when he gets out. I’ll be the one shooting fireworks into the sky and he’ll be the one walking into freedom, confident at last, that his last day ever spent in Criminal U is behind him.

  title: Two guys from Brooklyn on the side of justice
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    When my friend Tony Yarbough walked out of Attica for the last time he benefited from a monumental effort by many people. Like picking a lock that usually can’t be picked, the tumblers clicked into place and the gates of freedom — 21 years slammed shut — suddenly opened.

    [Two guys from Brooklyn](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/hamill-phil-smallman-helps-free-wrongfully-jailed-men-article-1.1607244) had a lot to do with it. Two guys from Brooklyn who were “just doing the right thing,” as one of them said.

    The two guys were college friends.  One, Denis Hamill, went on to become a New York Daily News columnist. The other, Phillip Smallman, a criminal defense lawyer. Both stayed close to their 718 area-code roots.

    “I knew Phil Smallman growing up in the old-school Park Slope, Brooklyn, of the 1970s when we were cramming for college, chasing girls, drinking cold ones at Farrell’s tavern and spinning dreams about kids and careers,” Hamill wrote.

    This relationship played a critical role in the freedom of Tony Yarbough. Hamill credits Smallman’s diligence as Yarbough’s attorney in bringing long overdue justice. But Hamill’s role should not be underestimated. The columnist was the first one in the entire New York area to pick up the drumsticks and begin the beats for justice.

    Smallman called his old buddy and asked him to write about it.

    “I read the defense lawyers’ brief to vacate the verdict, interviewed Yarbough and people from the Coney Island projects where the murders happened, and a family member of the third victim, another 12-year-old girl. Sources in the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office hinted the case smelled pretty bad,” Hamill wrote.

    “I wrote that Tony Yarbough was another victim of that triple homicide.”

    Hamill would be quick to say he was just doing his job. But it’s a critical part of the equation, the role of newspapers to be the old “voice for the voiceless.” Rarely is it true. We all have a voice. But that voice is very, very small once your locked up. Maybe justice comes for Tony and Phil over time. But no doubt, Hamill’s work of good old shoe-leather reporting and using his column’s platform to preach for justice mattered.

    Two guys from Brooklyn. It’s a great part of this story, a part Tony Yarbough will be forever grateful.

    Both made the 718 pretty damn proud by “doing the right thing.”

  title: Rethinking death penalty, life sentences and criminal justice reform
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Pope Francis used his tremendous popularity to advocate for a largely unpopular position this week: He called for the abolition of both the death penalty and life sentences, according to the Catholic News Service.

    With a gnarled finger pointed directly at the United States, the Pope “denounced what he called a ‘penal populism’ that promises to solve society’s problems by punishing crime instead of pursuing social justice.”

    All those American politicians tripping over themselves to get to the head of the line touting criminal justice reform after decades of indifference and epidemic incarceration, suddenly pulled one of those Fred Flinstone and Barney Rubble breaking maneuvers with feet in the dirt and screech marks in the prehistoric sand.

    Say What? they probably said. We want criminal justice reform but no death penalty? No life sentences? Let’s not get crazy.

    Politicians want criminal justice reform because its now fashionable. But they want to talk it without incurring the costs of enacting substantial reform. They have even less interest in assessing their role in the Pope’s perfectly parsed ‘penal populism.’ (Say that five times fast!)

    Politicians knew the billion-dollar boondoggle that is the American prison system was unsustainable, inefficient and ineffective. When 95 percent of all those incarcerated return to society where the odds are so stacked against them that a super-majority will re-offend at great cost to society, something is wrong with the “lock ’em up and throw away the key” mentality.

    When prisons and jails outnumber colleges and when it costs more to incarcerate an adult than educate a child, something’s amiss.

    But none of this is new. What’s new is polling numbers showed people were finally started to question the whole epidemic numbers of incarceration. What’s new is billionaire backers like the Koch Brothers on the right and George Soros on the left starting offering millions to politicians with a plan.

    And maybe, just maybe, what’s new is politicians started looking around and noticing that the incarceration system they unleashed was circling back around toward them. Don’t think for a minute they didn’t notice the sentences of Rod Blagojevich, Jesse Jackson Jr. and Ray Nagin and start rethinking the whole thing. Those were just the high-profile criminal charges. Check out just how rampant criminal charges against politicians really is by [clicking here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_state_and_local_politicians_convicted_of_crimes).

    In 2012 a New York Times columnist wrote that politicians were aware of the absolute dysfunction of our criminal justice system, but “lacked the political will” to do anything about it. By 2016 criminal justice reform will likely be the only bipartisan issue on both presidential planks regardless of who becomes the eventual nominees.

    That’s a sudden shift.

    The fact is Republicans golden ticket since the Willie Horton campaign against Michael Dukakis in 1988 was “tough on crime.” Democrats, reeling from the attack became even tougher on crime. As a new book, *The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America*, [makes the case](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/01/15/blame-liberals) liberals are also to blame for epidemic incarceration.

    Ironically, something good has come amid all this huffing and puffing by the big bad political wolves. Because politicos are talking about it, folks are interested in reading about it and the legitimate players on the reform scene who have been long ignored are getting the message of its value out to a formerly disinterested public.

    Case in point, [a new story](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/03/20/too-old-to-commit-crime?ref=hp-3-111) by The Marshall Project that shows the cost of life sentences far outweigh their value in protecting against future crime.

    The story notes significant congressional testimony on an idea that likely seems outlandish now, but will soon gain traction on its merit alone.

    The idea of a 21-year sentence for mass murder and terrorism may seem radically lenient in the United States, where life without parole is often presented as a humane alternative to the death penalty. Yet in testimony last week to a congressional task force on reforming the federal prison system, Marc Mauer, the director of the [Sentencing Project](http://www.sentencingproject.org/template/index.cfm), an advocacy group, suggested exactly that approach. He made the case for a 20-year cap on federal prison terms with an option for parole boards or judges to add more time if necessary to protect the public.

    Such a policy would “control costs” in a system that is now 40 percent over capacity, Mauer told the task force, and would “bring the United States more in line with other industrialized nations.”

    Of course, just a couple of years ago a “congressional task force on reforming the federal prison system” simply wouldn’t have existed. Politicians would have opted for root canal without Novocaine before getting their name associated with such a committee.

    This describes the new political will for criminal justice reform. Long silenced and ignored, facts long known are finally getting their day in the public forum. This is an essential first step toward change. It’s an essential step to begin considering whether death penalties and life sentences without the possibility of parole do more harm than good. It’s a step to asking the much needed question: what best serves a just society?

    The Pope using his bully pulpit doesn’t hurt either.

  title: From the depths, ex-con hits the heights with ‘Fixed’
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Every Saturday, Doug Piotter heads out to help other addicts and in so doing continues a remarkable journey of recovery. More than two decades of sobriety have convinced Doug of one thing: in a sober life, anything is possible.

    The proof? Piotter’s debut memoir, [Fixed: Dope Sacks, Dye Packs and the Long Welcome Back](https://www.amazon.com/Fixed-Dope-sacks-packs-welcome/dp/099658000X) has just been given the Kirkus Star, which enters the book in the competition for its Kirkus Prize award and the $50,000 prize that comes with it.

    > “The author’s life, as portrayed here, contains enough screw-ups for 10 dysfunctionality memoirs,” the review writes, “but unlike other memoirists, he eschews angst and self-pity and highlights the absurd humor of the predicaments he made for himself. The pathos here is all the more moving for being spare, understated, and well-earned from hard experience. A smart, occasionally wise, and always entertaining recollection of addiction, crime, punishment, and recovery.”

    No faint praise. Piotter has been called a lot of things, like ex-con, addict, felon, etc. But those describe where he’s been, not who is he or where he is going. Now words like businessman, craftsman, mentor, husband and award-winning author describe him.

    As chronicled in Fixed, Piotter’s gripping addiction unclenched during his time in federal prison for bank robberies. He has continued to champion the road to recovery for others, knowing well that no human being is beyond help. But it starts with the addict. A person has to want to make the change.

    Fixed is funny, but it also inspires. Anyone who reads it can know what Doug knows: If he can rebuild his life, they can too.

    Doug has never forgotten the depths that he has emerged from, continue to reach back and offer a hand to anyone who would follow his path. This book might be the one thing that helps a person see the hope that Doug lives every day. At the very least, they’ll laugh. And who doesn’t need a good laugh?

  title: 'Get ‘Fixed’: Post-prison life richer than expected'
  author: Doug Piotter
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I’m a wealthy man beyond what I could have ever dreamed, and it has nothing to do with money. I’ve lived more in the last 13 years than I did in the 42 prior to that. As it happens, it’s been 13 years since my release from prison.

    “What’re you going to do when you get out?” many of my old prison yard dogs would ask.

    I had no earthly idea what I would do, but I did know I wasn’t going to get loaded. I figured there’d be doors opening for me if I did the right thing. The size of the door knows no limits. It’s been a crazy ride.

    Now I talk a lot about my experiences. People in my recovery community kept telling me, “You should write a book.”

    So I did.

    *Fixed: Dope sacks, dye packs and the long welcome back* is that book. I’d be thrilled if you click [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0150I4HTQ) and buy it.

    This is one of the answers to those guys asking me all the time, “what are you going to do when you get out?”

    Who knew?

    Writing a story about my life is a little like being naked on the street, minus the arrest, I hope.

    I was in a treatment center in 1992 and we all met in the dining hall to recite an affirmation that started with, “I am.”

    I thought, how stupid is that.

    Then I went on about the business of getting high and doing time because instead of “I am” at that point “I wasn’t.”

    Now, I am.

    I am capable of believing that I have value as a human being no matter where I came from and that belief has been paying dividends in the form of others also believing in me, not to mention quality of life.

    Here’s an irony for you, the bank is going to give this ex-bank robber a brand new $24,000 car and trust that I will pay them back.

    “Did I hear right? Approved you say?”

    It sounds crazy to me, but not to them, because they are operating under the terms of “what have you done for me lately.”

    I have built a track record and a community.

    I’m excited to see where this whole book thing goes, and the more I get into the process of getting it out there, the more my idea of what success means shifts.

    How does one eat an elephant? one bite at a time.

    How did I ever arrive here? That corny tried and true slogan we’ve all heard a million times, one day at a time. There would be no success without the trying, and there would be no life without sobriety because I most definitely am.

    Doug Piotter, a friend of Criminal U, is pretty rare. His sense of humor, which comes through in its fully quirky, often hilarious, often dark style in his newly released book [Fixed: Dope sacks, dye packs and the long welcome back](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0150I4HTQ), is rare. But even more so is his success story. After a decade in prison and a crushing addiction, Doug got sober, stayed sober, stayed out of prison, build a business, married, built a successful life and more than a decade later, remains a positive light of inspiration for folks everywhere. Doug beat the odds. His book is a celebration of that unlikely story. But with Doug’s example and the ongoing effort of our Criminal U community, more and more people will have a similar success story to tell.

  title: Reggie Clemons murder conviction tossed out in Missouri
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |
    Reggie Clemons, who was once five days away from being executed by the state of Missouri, is no longer guilty of murder in the eyes of the court.

    In a 4-3 ruling by the Missouri State Supreme Court on Tuesday, Clemons murder conviction in the notorious Chain of Rocks Bridge murders was thrown out, and the case remanded back to circuit court. The state has 60 days to decide to try to retry Clemons.

    As a contributor to Criminal U, Clemons has contributed blog posts from Death Row. He is an ardent activist whose time in prison has been made far more difficult because of his determined opposition to the death penalty and corruption in the criminal justice system. Amnesty International has championed his cause and helped with his legal defense of his murder case.

    Clemons authored a book from Death Row, called From Slavery to a Hip Hop Nation.  He also brought attention to harassment by prison guards and sued the state for unauthorized listening to legal calls.  Clemons, who maintains his innocence of the murders and rape charges, was beaten for hours and forced to confess to murder as a 19-year-old without any prior convictions.

    Clemons is not free because of complex legal proceedings. While in prison, he was sentenced to 15 years for assaulting a corrections officer, which he says was self-defense from the abuse guards were dishing out to him. What’s more clear is that had he never been sentenced to die for a murder conviction that required police to beat a confession out of him and alter police records, he would have never been in prison to pick up the second charge.  And of course, with this high-profile case, the state is not likely to back down from retrying the case despite it being nearly 25 years old.

    The long legal road for Reggie Clemons continues, but it does so today with validation of Clemons’ long fight. Reggie has hope again of not being executed and perhaps one day soon being free.

    Many will claim he is guilty. Perhaps only Clemons knows for sure. But these facts are unassailable:
    - Clemons was beaten by police.
    - Clemons arrest report was altered.
    - Clemons who have already been executed had it not been for determined legal maneuvers that twice forced the state to delay despite a high level of “doubt” in this conviction.
    - One of the men convicted with Clemons has already been executed.

    This is our criminal “justice” system. This is the system that continues to execute people despite hundreds of men being exonerated for their crimes. We are a country that executes despite proof that many of those on death row are innocent or there simply because corrupt police believed them to be innocent.

    This is a broken system. It has already taken 25 years of Reggie Clemons life. How long will we tolerate these injustices?

  title: Oakland’s emergence flows through Community Works
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Oakland, Calif. is far too often known for its tragedies: The infamous Fruitvale station is in Oakland. The city’s riots and heavy-handed police responses too often made national news, as has crime rate and west-side violence.

    But perhaps what Oakland should truly be known for is not its past but its future. The city is a hot bed of grassroots innovation when it comes to combating stubborn problems of unemployment, crime, prison re-entry and homelessness.

    The recent rebirth of the downtown may too often [focus only on gentrification](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-s-Lake-Merritt-drawing-new-residents-5752202.php), but Oakland is more than the flight of out-priced hipsters fleeing San Francisco across the Bay Bridge. It’s a diverse community with deep, deep roots who have collectively been trying to improve the city for all its residents. That determined spirit has birthed numerous cutting edge examples of human rehabilitation and empowerment, as documented recently in a [cover story](http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/coming-home/Content?oid=4019784) by the East Bay Express.

    Oakland is also home to revitalization organizations like [Impact Hub Oakland](http://oakland.impacthub.net/), Defy Ventures, and Community Works West.

    Located in Oakland, [Community Works West](http://www.communityworkswest.org/) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to using the arts and education as a catalyst for change with underserved populations in the San Francisco Bay Area. It’s sort of a de facto Alpha and Omega to the advocacy ranks in Oakland, having been around a long time and having a consistent presence amid the truly empowering things happening throughout the city. Community Works is both old guard and new school, which makes it a true gem within this emerging city.

    By connecting the power of the arts to the power of hope it has a recipe for human recovery that is simple, effective and demonstrable.

    October is a great month to become more familiar with both the incredible upside of Oakland as a whole and the specific work of Community Works West.  The organization will host two events that breathe the spirit of human empowerment, recovery and success.

    On October 16 at Oakland City Hall, Community Works will host an opening reception for an exhibit called “The Welcome Home Project: Getting Out and Staying Out.” It’s a series of photographic stories of people who have left defied the long off of rehabilitation and succeeded after re-entering society following a time of incarceration.

    The reception is from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Executive Director Ruth Morgan — a true leader in Oakland — will be on hand, along with the heroes of the exhibit, those who have shown the true power of the human spirit.

    On Oct. 24, a panel discussion called “Getting Out and Staying Out,” sponsored by Community Works, will be held at the First Unitarian Church of Oakland at 7 p.m. (on the corner of 14th and Castro streets).  The panel will be hosted Micky Duxbury, Project Coordinator of Welcome Home Project, for the formerly incarcerated, their families and friends and the general public about transformed lives. Share dessert, music and community in this frank and needed discussion.

    The Welcome Home project grew out of support from CAL Humanities in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts.

    For those in the Bay Area with a genuine heart for their community, we strongly encourage you to show your support and learn more about these events — and meet the people whose lives have been touched and transformed as a result.

    Oakland is far much more than its troubles and the media’s persistent focus on the city’s ills. A city is more than its crime rate and unemployment; in fact, how it addresses these human problems says more about the city than the statistics and stories ever could.

    Come out in October and see it for yourself.

  title: Put "Positive Thought Arming" into action
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I wrote recently about the power of a tool I learned in prison called "Positive Thought Arming." But just thinking about positive thought arming doesn’t put it to use. You have to arm yourself with these thoughts, which takes time to prepare and plan so you can put them into action. When you do, they will infuse your life with the power of the sun breaking into the dark.

    First, take two days and jot down every positive thought that comes to mind.

    Second, spend 15 minutes of each of those days sitting in silence allowing you mind to go to any memories you have that are profoundly positive. Ask yourself, “What was the best day of your life?” and then replay it. What songs stick in your mind and bring back wonderful memories? Do you have a favorite scripture or saying on the wall. When did you feel you were at “your best?” Replay all you can remember about that.

    Third, at the end of two days try to come up with five thoughts, sayings, poems, lyrics or even memories that have a powerfully positive effect on you. Write them down. First in detail, then write what you might call a table of contents, with brief words that key up those thoughts. Write them on index cards.

    Fourth, carry them around with you for a week, using at least three different times for at least five minutes of each day to memorize your thoughts.

    Fifth, repeat the above exercises and add at least five more thoughts.

    Sixth, if you lose focus and forget for a few days, start over from scratch. Keep at it until you can complete all the steps in succession.

    Seventh, once you’ve memorized at least 10 positive thoughts, repeat them once a week at a minimum or any time you feel like your focus is shifting to a negative view. Use them in times of turmoil or simply to keep your internal positive motor running.

    The amazing part of this is all this intentionally positive focus will dramatically correct your mood, view of life and thoughts before you ever put this into practice. Your whole focus will be on positive things, which inevitably crowds out the negative.

    Finally, build in some accountability. Tell others what you are doing, or better yet, simply sign in below to post a comment here and join the effort. Post your favorite positive thoughts here so others can benefit from them as well. Let’s build a library of positive thoughts to arm us all for the fight to reclaim our best selves.

    It may seem simplistic or even silly, but that’s how powerful thoughts can be. It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out to change them. “Just do it,” as Nike says, which incidentally is number six on my list of 31.

  title: 'Rule #24: Be at peace as much as it depends on you'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "“__Be at peace as much as it depends on you__,” -St. Paul
    the Apostle in a letter to the church in Rome.\n\nThe world needs peacemakers.
    It always has and always will. So why are they so often in short supply?\n\nStill
    I’m glad that when Paul called us to be at peace, he did so with a caveat, recognizing
    it takes two for peace.\n\nI appreciate the practical wisdom of this scripture
    verse. Peace requires a lack of enemies or at least enemies disinclined to wage
    war. While we can do a lot to antagonize others and create the conditions for
    fighting, we can’t always ensure peace. Sometimes we simply find ourselves at
    war, and we can’t figure out what why anyone is so mad. Sometimes we wage war
    against innocents. The calculus of peace is really basic math: It takes one to
    fight, but two for peace.\n\nPeace is an elusive goal. It’s like catching mist.\n\nSo
    the Apostle Paul sets a reasonable level of expectation in dispensing his advice
    on our actions with others. He says it simply, in a long list of basic advice
    he fires off at the end of a historic letter, one Scholar N.T. Wright believes
    is the seminal apologetic for the Christian faith. He says simply, with no prelude,
    to “be at peace” … but then adds the important postscript, “as much as it depends
    on you.” \n\nI’d guess that Paul, no stranger to conflict, knew too well the math
    of peace.\n\nI also like this verse because frankly it surprises me. My beef with
    Paul is he doesn’t strike me as the most peaceful guy. His old Pharisaical nature,
    that part of his DNA that spurred him to violently defend his theological beliefs,
    still rollicks around his reformed and spirit-cleansed mind. He writes openly
    about — and the Book of Acts chronicles his demanding nature — the rifts he develops
    with those closest to him. His tone is combative with those he challenges. On
    one hand, I applaud his courage. On the other hand I cringe at his personality
    type.\n\nI much prefer the esoteric John. I take comfort that Jesus did too. John
    was his best friend after all. Guys like Peter and Paul were critical to the mission,
    but it wouldn’t surprise me in the least if they made Jesus a little uncomfortable
    at times. Jesus liked to hang with drunks and prostitutes, so much so that religious
    leaders called him a drunkard and a glutton. That really makes me smile about
    Jesus. Paul, you wouldn’t catch him hanging out over pizza and pitchers of beer.\n\nAll
    of which is to say that when Paul offers this very reasoned bit of advice, I like
    him better. It is surprising, and well, pretty cool, for lack of a better word.
    It’s also really good advice.\n\nMost of us could spend a couple of lifetimes
    rooting out the anxiety, discomfort, anger and war cries within ourselves. Instead,
    too often, we focus on the war cries of others and ignore our own inner voice.\n\nWorrying
    about what spins other people really doesn’t need to be our domain. Jesus eluded
    to that when he cautioned us to hold off on “removing the speck from a brother’s
    eye.” If only more people would just do that one thing. The world would be a more
    peaceful place. Something tells me it might be a bit more useful than challenging
    teenage boys not to masturbate, or trying to get me to stop cussing, or worrying
    about everyone believing the same exact things, or telling people who they can
    marry, or a whole host of other things our religious leaders get all worked up
    about.\n\nSo despite its practical nature to be at peace in the areas we control
    and leave controlling others behind, my experience tells me it’s far easier said
    than done.\n\nSpeaking of surprising, have you met someone who truly seems at
    peace? I’ve met folks who captured a little bit of the peace genie as it flowed
    out of the bottle. These rare folks enter a room and calm settles. Their smiles
    and kind eyes are like U.N. Negotiators. They bring peaceful compromise into the
    most fractured of situations.\n\nNow this may seem a bit redundant coming on the
    heels of Rule 19: Eschew violence. But it’s not. They are different. Avoiding
    violence is an outward behavior. It is a “do no harm” approach. But the world
    needs more. It needs an active measure of doing something different. Christ started
    his most important sermon with this: “blessed are the peacemakers.” Peacemakers
    act. They act peacefully. The splash down in our lives and send out cascading
    ripples of peace that flow from the Spirit of God, up from their center being
    and out to others like a wave. It’s inner peace set in motion. The people who
    capture it and live it are the diamonds of this rough earth. They sparkle.\n\nI’m
    not one of these people. Not yet anyway. I’m more of the spin-cycle type. A Tazmanian
    Devil swirling and twirling my way into chaos simply by existing. Sometime my
    ability to create disharmony astounds even me. It would be hilarious if it wasn’t
    so discouraging, because I want to be at peace. I want a peaceful energy to flow
    from me.\n\nLike I said, easier said than done.\n\nStill it’s worth vigilant attention
    and practice. It’s a notable goal to try to bring peace into our lives and to
    extend it to those who are kind enough to love us. I think about this and am reminded
    of the Bill Murray character in What about Bob? “Baby steps Bob. Baby steps on
    the bus Bob.”\n\nThat’s me and peace. Hopefully you can make larger strides."

  title: Woman on death row could re-ignite anti-death penalty movement
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I didn’t find God in prison. I took Her there with me. We just got reunited in a badly needed way.

    But as a February [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/28/us/a-death-row-inmate-finds-common-ground-with-theologians.html?_r=0) on Kelly Gissendaner noted, “a lot of convicted felons find God in prison.” This reuniting or conversion or rapprochement of spirituality tends to be viewed at best cautiously and at worst cynically.

    In most cases I think it best to keep such things close to the heart, like all good loving relationships. It rarely helps to talk of such intimacies between a “convicted felon” and God. Why bother, I think? I prefer to live the relationship out and leave the judgement of its veracity to others.

    Kelly Gissendaner doesn’t have that option. She is literally fighting for her life and those fighting hardest on her behalf are largely doing so because of her prison conversion.

    I can relate to this woman, a “friend of theologians” having studied many of the same subjects and courses–including Jurgen Moltmann and Deitrich Bonhoeffer–during my years in seminary. Her education, spiritual growth and personal practice go far beyond the so-called “prison conversion” story that causes eyes to roll. She is an example of what it means to truly believe in faith and forgiveness:

    Hopefully though, the conversation will move past faith and toward justice, from forgiveness to reform. Because frankly, the anti-death penalty effort in this country needs a renewed burst of energy and focus. As Criminal U’s friend and Death Row inmate Reggie Clemons says, “I wonder what happened to the anti-death penalty movement?”

    Few could deny that the attention, upheaval and outspoken opposition to Gissendaner’s execution is solely based on two factors: she is a woman and she is a devout Christian whose conversion in prison has been lived out faithfully and enthusiastically for years behind the bars and barbed wires of Georgia’s death row.

    Some are calling a snowstorm and a cloudy drug acts of a benevolent, loving, forgiving God because both [delayed Gissendaner’s execution](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/02/ga-woman-put-to-death-in-husbands-murder/24286007/) in the final hours in recent days.

    Twice she has woken up on the morning of her arrest only to twice be delayed. Sister Helen Prejean, of Dead Man Walking fame, tweeted out that this was torture, plain and simple.

    Evangelical Christians are calling for the courts to commute her sentence to be life in prison. Barring a dramatic shift in state politics, the only legal option she has left is if the U.S. Supreme Court stays the next execution date to consider her appeal, which the court did last month in the still lingering case of Les Bower.

    Conservative Christians tend to be the strongest defenders of the death penalty, but many in this case point to the dramatic changes Gissendaner has made as evidence that people can change and be rehabilitated. Having spent time with many convicted killers, having meals, walking prison years, I know without a doubt this to be true, God or not.

    Gissandaner’s case may lead to important conversations from people of faith on both sides of this issue that could either severely limit the death penalty or find a common ground on the need for far more regulation of the murky, secretive and disparate ways we execute in this country. Justice, it would seem, would be a common ground that people of faith can stand on for horribly needed reform. We know innocent people are on death row. We see them walking free after being exonerated. We know people like Les Bower and Reggie Clemons have legal issues that cause considerable cause for doubt, but both have been just days — or even hours away — from their executions. We know the process is flawed; we’ve seen horribly “botched” executions that caused terrible suffering.

    We know this isn’t working.

    Yet  a handful of states continue to execute regularly. So every case is critical, including Gissendaner who may just have God sending storms and ruining drugs on her behalf.

    But beyond the faith and forgiveness issue, let’s consider again the justice issue.

    Is it just that the actual murderer of Gissendaner’s husband took a plea deal and could be paroled as early as 2023. Yet Gissendaner who encouraged the act but did not commit it only asks to be commuted to a life sentence. Is this disparity just?

    Is it just to remove a model prisoner who helps inculcate an often inhumane prison environment with grace and love a benefit to society bent on needed prison reform? So much work of reform must be done inside prisons if the work we do outside is to be effective. Is society served by this execution?

    Executions model deterrents in theory to other would-be murderers. But does rehabilitation, in this case evident to many people who know Gissendaner, deserve to model potential re-sentencing that are still acts of justice, like life in prison over a death penalty?

    The anti-death penalty needs focus. People of faith need God-centered dialogue. True reform must come from new insights with new focus on societal needs and genuine justice, not political objectives that fuel executions in this country.

    Perhaps God is moving in this case to stay the executioner’s hand. By all rights if anyone deserve a degree of leniency Kelly Gissandaner is it. But let’s let the uproar lead to dialogue, which leads to common points of agreement from which the plant of reform can be built.

    Anti-death penalty advocates: Are you listening? The work here in Georgia is only starting. We need to stay the course.

  title: Prisoner’s beard offers Supreme Court a game of inches
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Surfing the prison-related news and one story stands out
    but in a sneaky way. It’s layered with complexity and subtle overtones of prejudice,
    unfettered power in the Department of Corrections and inconsistency from prison
    to prison.\n\nThe story only surfaced today on the broad stage because of where
    it was debated: The Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the issue as the first
    case of this session. It centers around beard length in prison. Prison officials
    claim it’s a security issue (they always do) despite prisons all over the country
    that have no guidelines about beard lengths. Massive beards — the type that make
    Brian Wilson’s beard look tame — are common in prison. They are nearly as ubiquitous
    as skullets (bald guys with long hair, refusing to give in to the need to surrender).\n\nLong
    beards aren’t rare. Yet what is rare — so rare you can’t find an example in a
    google search — is a prisoner somehow using his beard to escape or attack someone
    or to smuggle in heroin.  Has it happened? Sure, maybe. And as they argued before
    the court, an escapee could shave to hide better. Again, has it happened? Of course.
    But does it justify a law against beards? Unlikely.\n\nSo now we have the Supreme
    Court debating how long is too long. Insane. But again, this is layered. The beard
    in question is not a biker, or an old guy or a guy trying not to look like the
    mug shot that was blasted all about his arrest for rape (all of which are common
    in prison) but a Muslim. THAT is the issue here. It’s why black guys are often
    told they have to chop off dreads. It’s why guards rarely will speak Spanish to
    undocumented residents who end up behind bars, and then discipline them when they
    don’t understand. It’s about power, the abuse of power and in this case, religious
    discrimination that has no place in our culture.\n\nRead on, but read with eyes
    wide open:\n> A day after disposing of their most controversial and consequential
    cases — those involving same-sex marriage — the justices turned to the question
    of whether Muslim prisoner Gregory Holt’s half-inch beard could threaten the security
    of the Arkansas prison system.\n> \n> No, most of the justices appeared to conclude
    — but they worried that the next cases might involve longer beards or other religious
    demands, with no end in sight. At what point, several of them said, should a state’s
    security interests surmount a prisoner’s religious rights?\n> \n> “Religious beliefs
    aren’t reasonable. I mean, religious beliefs are categorical,” Justice Antonin
    Scalia said. “God tells you.”\n> \n> “What do we do, just litigate a dozen cases
    until we settle on one-and-three-quarters inches?” asked Chief Justice John Roberts.\n>
    \n> The issue before the court was Arkansas’ requirement that prisoners be clean-shaven,
    unless they have a medical reason for keeping a quarter-inch beard. While more
    than 40 state prison systems allow beards in general, Holt had agreed to keep
    his to a half-inch — virtually negating the chance he could hide weapons or contraband
    in it, and making it harder for him to change his appearance by shaving.\n> \n>
    A law passed unanimously by Congress in 2000 was intended to protect prisoners’
    religious rights, much like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 was
    meant to protect religious freedom in general. That law was cited by the court
    in June when it allowed family-owned corporations with religious objections to
    be exempted from providing health insurance for contraceptives.\n> \n> The justices
    appeared to agree that the law regarding prisoners does work in Holt’s favor.
    Several also belittled the state’s stated fears: that an escaped prisoner could
    hide a weapon or contraband in his beard, and change his appearance after an escape
    by shaving.\n> \nvia [Prisoner’s beard offers Supreme Court a game of inches](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/07/supreme-court-religion-prisoner-beard/16856023/).\n\nThese
    are the types of things that happen inside a closed system that hasn’t been scrutinized

  title: Ambitious ex-inmate rebuilds through power of the pen
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Andolian Napraja is ambitious. He also is skilled and driven
    and a lot of things that had he been raised in another culture with a different
    parent might have made him a CEO of a multi-million dollar startup instead of
    a kingpin/founder of a startup drug cartel. Andolian simply went into the family
    business, just like so many young, driven, smart people do when they start out.
    Like so many children of inmates, he chose the high-risk, high-reward life of
    their parents.\n\nIt landed him in prison for 15 years.\n\nNow he’s been outside
    for 60 days and the instinct to hustle to rebuild his life–and do it quickly–has
    returned. This time, Andolian is going to do it the right way.\n\nUnlike so many
    young men sent to prison for a long stretch, Andolian didn’t spend his time learning
    more about crime and figuring out how to get back on top when he got out. He took
    the way we tout here at Criminal U. He rebelled by getting educated. He developed
    a love for writing. He wrote novels viewed through the unique lens of his life
    in the drug trade.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. His ambition showed itself
    long before he landed inside Criminal U:\n> I grew up in Detroit, Michigan, and
    started hustling when I was 12 years old, selling heroin and crack cocaine for
    older drug dealers around my neighborhood.  I dropped out of school in the 9th
    grade and began hustling for myself when I was 15.\n\nAndolian had a bigger version
    of the local drug dealers he had hustled for as a kid. His father, he says, was
    “the leader of one of the most powerful and richest drug cartels in Bogotá and
    Medellin, Colombia.”\n\n\nSo Andolian’s idea of the family business was entrepreneurial.
    He wanted his own operation. He created a start-up.\n\n> By the time I was 16
    years old I was making thousands of dollars a day. Soon my craving for fast money
    increased and I began to recruit soldiers and travel to other cities to sell cocaine
    and crack cocaine.\n> \n> I made my first million dollars in Indianapolis, Indiana
    then went to Charleston, West Virginia and became the king of crack cocaine. \n>
    \n> It was my vision for my crew and I to be separate from other drug organizations
    so we began to call ourselves “Junior Cartel,” … I created a set of rules and
    principles for all of us to live by, and we grew into a family, making more money
    than any of us ever dreamed or believed was possible.\n\nThe name Junior Cartel
    was a direct link to his father. Cartel and Sons. And as expected, he soon took
    a heavy fall. He was indicted in late 2000 and sentenced to 15 years.\n\n> I spent
    the next 14 and a half years of my life behind bars paying for my crimes. While
    I was incarcerated I began to educated myself in science, social studies, history,
    finance,  mathematics, and writing.\n\nHe got out in March. The money is gone,
    the power is gone, the stature, too. He’s been a prison number for most of his
    adulthood.\n\nWhat’s not gone is that innate drive, ambition and desire to thrive.\n\nI’ve
    been working on getting my life together, but struggle everyday like many people
    who live in the neighborhood I’m from. I now live in Detroit, Michigan where I
    fight to change my life and find employment.\n\nAndolian wrote novels in prison.
    He took the ambitious step of reaching out to literary agent Michael Larsen. Larsen,
    one of the more generous people in this field you’ll ever meet, wrote him back
    encouraging Andolian in his craft. They stayed in touch. When Andolian got out,
    Larsen connected him to Criminal U.  Andolian’s dream of publishing one of his
    novel is about to happen. Through our author’s page and with our editorial support
    we are going to help him publish his book, Colombian Blood, within the next month.\n\nWe
    have no doubt this bright, ambitious writer will do everything he can to make
    it a success, which is why we are asking you to do everything you can to help
    him get started. We are sponsoring an [Indiegogo Life campaign](https://life.indiegogo.com/fundraisers/rebuilding-a-life-through-the-power-of-story--2/x/10410349)

    work and getting re-established. He faces come unusual challenges and with it
    the need for small, but important funds. Read more here.\n\nIf everyone who clicks

  title: 'Rule #26: Make some rules'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "I had a birthday recently, one that a few years ago would
    have made me sound very old even to me. But I noticed something inside, despite
    all the ribbing about my stern push to the deep end of “middle age.” I didn’t
    feel old at all. Not a tiny little bit. I told everyone all day I was turning
    36. Truthfully I felt younger than that.\n\nI even tried it on my daughter who
    is 20 years younger than me and is fast approaching the end of her twenties.\n\n“I’m
    only 36,” I said.\n\n“Well dad, that would be impossible,” she said.\n\n“No it
    isn’t. I was a precocious eight-year old with a lot of swagg and a good game for
    the ladies,” I said.\n\nShe rolled her eyes at me and muttered, “you never will
    grow up.”\n\nNope, I thought. Not a chance in hell.\n\nBut — and this is where
    I have changed some of the years — I will be an adult. I may not grow up or even
    allow myself to grow old for a good long while, but I will be an adult.\n\nAdults
    shape the world. They participate in its progress. They work and make contributions.
    They have the discipline to pursue the art that lies un-mined in their souls and
    bring it forth to add to the beauty in the world. They love. They birth the next
    generation. They also hopefully help post the signposts for others to follow.
    Like Miller Beer, they pass along “The High Life.” Some of those needed signposts
    are rules.\n\nAdults, it seems, are the ones who usually make the rules.  For
    a guy who has struggled with rules his whole life, accepting my responsibility
    here is a big part of being an adult. Not only do I have to make rules, I have
    to follow them. It’s part of living well, I finally figured out.\n\nAny rules
    for life must remain a fluid and dynamic process. We are both student and teacher,
    judge and defendant, parent and child, penitent and priest, all at the same time.
    Only God holds the final answer key and like a teacher watching her pupils study,
    she doesn’t have any plans to let us peek at the answers. We can’t cheat the exam
    life — not and do well, anyway. We have to keep learning.\n\nIn this book I’ve
    tried to kick start the conversation of this dynamic process. I posted a couple
    of dozen rules that make sense to me, any of which are open for debate, modification
    or dismissal. Each of us must contribute to the effort, tweaking it to produce
    the best possible benefit. I accept and expect a degree of revision by every adult
    who wishes to find his or her best path.\n\nI’m finished (for now at least). I
    return to where this started, a letter from a father to his son on his 18th birthday.
    It’s a humble effort to aid your rite of passage even as it now continues long
    past that landmark day.\n\nIt’s your turn, son. What would you add? What have
    you learned? Do you recall your red-faced moments and the lessons learned?  Or
    simply do you know of  lessons learned that are far too universal not to share?
    Add it here. Only when your fingerprints stain this work as well as mine will
    it become a useful road map for your authentic journey.\n\nI’ll offer a few final
    guidelines for rule making.\n\n- Don’t add unnecessary rules. They create clutter
    and confusion. A rule should matter.\n- Obviously I left off a good many rules
    we learned as children, common sense things like “don’t kill” (remember the the
    old George Carlin routine, “That’s a good fucking rule”? If its obvious, I don’t
    think we need it here).\t\n- When in doubt, refer to The Ten Commandments, which
    still make a good bit of sense, especially since God bothered to emerge from heaven
    and write them with his own finger. They must have mattered to God a great deal,
    so it would behoove us to follow them.\n- I will point out that Jesus showed the
    very typical reaction of a son reaching adulthood and breaking free from his father
    a bit. Notice he came along and said, “Yes, pop had 10 commandments, but you know
    what? I can make it even easier. I boiled the whole thing down to one rule!” You
    need no encouragement to go your own way too (which pisses me off to no end even
    as it thrills me) so go ahead and be bold.\n- Breaking rules remains valuable:
    I take great comfort in the fact that Jesus didn’t seem to like rules much more
    than I do. Ever notice how much fun he had making a mockery of the hundreds of
    Pharisaical rules so prevalent in his day? He couldn’t just make the blind guy
    see, he went and did it on the Sabbath, breaking a rule. How cool is that? Heal
    a guy and get a chuckle twisting the tail of all those finger-wagging no-mongers
    at the same time.\n- Rules should build us up not tear us down. I think Jesus
    might have been trying to point out that rules for life should flow from the creative
    energy of the world. They should restore the glory of Eden (again, only one rule!
    But of course we blew it and ate the apple opening the floodgates of rules found
    in Leviticus and Deuteronomy…sigh) and make us all more fully human. Rules that
    flow from the destructive energy in life bring results that do great harm, like
    say, “All Jews must die.” Terrible rule. But we need not be near as extreme as
    Nazi Germany to realize the potential for abuse within us. We are also surrounded
    by hateful rules. Banning two people who love each other from the joy of marriage
    because their DNA makes them homosexual is a rule that causes a great deal of
    pain, not to mention embarrassment for all of us who allow it to stand.\n- A rule
    doesn’t have to liberal like the one I just mentioned. It just needs to affirm
    people, not tear them down. I love several conservatives who contribute wonderful
    rules. Looking back I wish I had paid better attention to them. It’s not like
    prison was on my bucket list.\n\nIn short, it’s taken me a good part of three
    decades of adulthood to realize that good rules are indeed signposts along this
    terrifically complex, beautiful, wondrous and arduous thing called life. They
    move us forward while hemming us in just enough to find our best path. The point
    us toward the goal of this life as expressed by Jesus, “God’s will be done, on
    Earth as it is in heaven.” Rules done well aide our transformation rather than
    stymie it.\n\nConsider that sentence just a moment. Never in a million years would
    I have thought I’d write that. But I did, and I believe it, which goes to show
    even I can be an adult even when I refuse to grow up.\n\nHopefully good rules
    transcend our ideological differences, our political differences (Ok, I’ll apologize
    for the Republican cracks a bit earlier…sorry about that) and our personal biases,
    instead of finding a higher plan of basic truths to help us be more fully human.
    Or maybe they are something far less lofty and basically suggest some ideas to
    think about. Either way, I’m glad to consider them.\n\nI welcome your input. Because
    after all, it’s your turn."

  title: 'Rule #20- Say ‘I’m Sorry’'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I wonder why two words can often be so hard to say, so loaded with hidden meaning, so filtered by expression. If two more confusing, yet necessary words exist, I’m not sure I know what they are.

    Why do people struggle to say, “I’m sorry?” Or worse, why do they say it so reflexively with so little meaning, seemingly unaware that to do so is often so much more hurtful than saying nothing at all.

    For a time in Criminal U my favorite TV show was NCIS. I didn’t have much choice. My cell mate who owned the TV loved the show. USA channel plays marathons of old episodes all the time. Like it not, I watched it like it was my favorite TV show. Why fight it?

    Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs is the head of NCIS. He teaches his agents rules for the job, which really are a code for life. Watching this show gave me the structure for this entire book, which I guess is a compliment, or simply a testimony to the power of brainwashing.

    Next thing I know, I’m writing my “rules” just like ole Agent Gibbs.

    Gibbs told his agents, “Never say you’re sorry. It’s a sign of weakness.” I disagreed with that rule. It sounds arrogant.

    Then one episode, Gibbs said he was sorry. His friend said “you don’t say sorry… Your rule…?”

    Gibbs replied, “That doesn’t apply to friends.”

    I felt better about Gibbs rules.

    Two words. Said sincerely they pack a powerful antidote for emotional pain. Nothing more needs to be said. If you love somebody, you simply have to be able to see your errors, how you hurt them even when you don’t think you did or didn’t intend to hurt them at all. Or you have to recognize that you really did intend to hurt them, which does happen, even in love.

    “I’m sorry” says you matter.

    Said properly your eyes speak volumes. They cure so many emotional wounds.

    They also work wonders on the speaker. They gently wash a stubborn and prideful heart in humility. They remind us we aren’t infallible. They help us look at ourselves and improve.

    I’m sorry is powerful. So use it wisely. Don’t waste it unless fired from the gun of sincerity. Nothing backfires as destructively as “I’m sorry” said carelessly or habitually.

    “I’m sorry” is like package marked fragile, or maybe stamped with “explosive” across it. It is of great worth. When needed, open this package and use it wisely.

    Open with care, but do open. Because you are not always right. Thank God for that.

  title: 'Rule #17: Confront your pride'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    My close friend Mike is a conservative. I’m a liberal. Yet we don’t clash over our faith. We celebrate it. It’s why he’s like a brother to me, or at least one of a gajillian reasons and why I am like a brother to him.

    We were both athletic in our heyday. We’re both driven. We both work with a passion to succeed. I trash talk. I can’t bait him to return the fodder, even though it’s far more his culture as a black man, than it is mine. Every time I jab at him he says, “Oh man,” Eyes rolling as a huge smile lights across his face. “Oh man. We’ll see about that. Yes we will.”

    He just won’t take the bait.

    A couple of times in the years I’ve known him, I heard him gently suggest I should take a look at my pride. It can trip you up, he’d say.

    I’d shirk it off. Pride to me was thinking you’re better than you are. That’s not exactly my thorn of the flesh. I felt confident in my skills and comfortable when others had skills different or better than mine. Ambition shouldn’t be confused with pride, I thought. And it shouldn’t. But he was talking about pride, not ambition, not confidence, not esteem. I should have listened.

    Because the next time we talked about it was when Mike came to see me in prison.

    For eight months I had been smashing my head against those walls that hemmed me in. Every cell in the make-up that is me fired furiously against my powerlessness. A born problem-solver couldn’t solve anything. Anything. And in that conflicted state I grew weary. In the weariness I opened my ears to the spiritual truths I’d long ignored. In my ears I heard Mike’s voice. “Be careful brother. Be careful.”

    As he came to see me we sat across from each other, a glass wall dividing us. He smiled that huge smile. We picked up our phones.

    “How did you know it was my pride?” I asked first thing.

    He was speechless. Then he laughed. Then he said “God is good.”

    “Yes,” I said “He is he’s pretty tough too. Believe that.”

    Mike just shook his head and then looked in my eyes.

    “You’re doing good. I can see it.”

    “I am. Barely”

    Before he left he vowed to do anything I needed to get on my feet when I get out.

    “What is your goal?” he asked. “What do you want to do? I’ll help you.”

    “I don’t know,” I said. “Let me think about it.”

    And I did. Back locked in my cell I meditated on the question. I breathed it in and out during yoga over and over. I sifted my thoughts. I’ve always just wanted to write books. I wanted to be a daily person of calm for my children. I wanted to be with my wife every single night when my head hit the pillow. This was still what I wanted.

    Then I tried to listen. “What is my goal?” I asked.

    I recalled a memory verse I learned at 16 years old. It had a tune to it that I recalled. I couldn’t, at first, recall the verse. I took a guess and flipped to Micah. It was right there, where I had left it so many years ago. I picked it up and breathed it in and out the rest of the week.

    Mike came back to see me on Easter Sunday.

    “What are you doing here?” I asked. “Why aren’t you in church with your family?”
    He spread his hands wide.

    “This is church,” he said in the receiver, looking at me through glass. “You are my family.”

    I felt my throat grow tight. He noticed and tried to make easy conversation. I cut him off.

    “I know my goal,” I said.

    He nodded, go on.

    “Micah 6:8, “He has shown thee, oh man, what is good and what the Lord requires of thee. But to love Mercy, and to do justly, and to walk humbly with thy God.”

    I could hear that faint crackley, echoey sound that makes visits like these difficult and distant. But this silence transcended the glass and the circumstance. This silence allowed God to join our visit, to celebrate Easter Sunday with us.

    We didn’t know it but a lot was born that Easter Sunday. I began my rise from the dead. That alignment of priorities opened the way for God to begin a new, terrible, necessary, difficult refinement in my life. Exactly one Easter later I fasted for 24 hours, preparing to leave prison. I thought a new day was about to be born, and I guess it was. But it wasn’t what I had in mind. I was banned from seeing my wife on my release. I was put in a difficult trans-leave program with the odds of success stacked against me. Little did I know it, but I’d return to prison, I’d do the entire sentence all over again without having committed any new crimes, still paying a long, difficult, extreme price for my pride.

    But it took all that to learn something of humility that Mike suggested I learn years ago. It took all that to fully learn you have to confront your pride. It took all that for me to align my life with God’s plan, to learn to walk humbly. It took all that for me to accept this new phase, to break through my unwillingness to serve, to let the vision of Criminal U, of service, of reconciliation and reform to emerge. It took all that for me to find this path.

    Finally, Mike broke the silence.

    “Yes,” he said “Yes. That’s a good goal.”

    It was, one I once believed in. If only I hadn’t left it behind so many years ago. Thank God for a brother like Mike that helped me find it.

    Dream big. Live well. Be a success. But always, always, check yourself. Confront your pride. It truly does go before a fall.

  title: 'Willie Brown sums it up: study cop mentality'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Urban outrage is not going away any time soon. It may be tamped down from time to time only to re-ignite in different cities across the landscape from major cities like Baltimore and New York to outliers like Ferguson, Mo. and Sanford, Fla.

    Uprisings of protest will continue in places like Oakland, a good city with emerging leadership desperately trying to move past its crime-ridden and tumultuous past. They will flare up spontaneously and rise up through crafty planning. The incidents may grow to feel remote and interest may wane, but a betting man would feel safe knowing something new in a different place will re-ignite things all over again.

    Why?

    Because the central issue has not yet been addressed, says no less of an expert than former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.

    Speaking of the latest outcry in Baltimore, [Brown wrote](http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Look-at-police-mentality-for-answers-to-brutality-6237600.php), “This is not about a white cop versus black citizen. This is about cop versus citizen, which is really what the issue ought to be when it comes to police misconduct.”

    Brown set the nail and then drove it home with this:

    “This time the media should go where the dialogue needs to be, and that’s the cop mentality, something we’ve never really dealt with in this country.”

    As one of the first black mayors of a major city, Brown would know. As one of California’s most unabashed political insiders, Brown writes his weekly column from a reservoir of insight.  He writes what every significant civic leader knows: We don’t want to expose what Brown calls the “cop mentality.”

    But like it or not, until its exposed and changed, police violence, crime, abuse and injustice will continue, even knowing that the nation’s last raw nerve has been exposed and any outlandish conduct will become news.

    Hubris can do that. I know first-hand. And in more than 15 years as a journalist and more than five within the criminal justice system as a convicted felon, I know I’ve never seen a stronger, insular and arrogant system as the police.

    [A telling article](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8661977/race-police-officer) posted by a former St. Louis police officer pinpoints this mentality from his first-hand experience. Reddit Hudson says a national police trainer named K.L. Williams believes, “On any given day, in any police department in the nation, 15 percent of officers will do the right thing no matter what is happening. Fifteen percent of officers will abuse their authority at every opportunity. The remaining 70 percent could go either way depending on whom they are working with.”

    Hudson that mirrors his own experience, where he saw courageous civil servants and unfettered racists operate every day behind the Blue Shield of the police:

    “I worked with people like the president of my police academy class, who sent out an email after President Obama won the 2008 election that included the statement, ‘I can’t believe I live in a country full of ni**er lovers!!!!!!!!’ He patrolled the streets in St. Louis in a number of black communities with the authority to act under the color of law.”

    That is the cop mentality that Willie Brown also knows about and says needs to be studied, just as is the mentality of those who serve honorably but refuse to hold their fellow officers in account.

    Hudson says the 70 percent is where change must occur: “That remaining 70 percent of officers are highly susceptible to the culture in a given department. In the absence of any real effort to challenge department cultures, they become part of the problem.”

    We know their is a disconnect between what police represent and how they conduct themselves. We’ve all experienced in say, traffic court, where we know we stand little chance when it is our word against the police officer. Judges simply believe the police, despite ample evidence they are no more trustworthy than the average citizen. We see it every day in types of profiling and institutional attitudes that are perpetuated by the “cop mentality.”

    Hudson again offers rare insight gleaned from being both black and a police officer.  He notes a recent Gallup Poll found that people ranked police in the top five of ethics and morality.

    “The profession — the endeavor — is noble,” he writes. “But this myth about the general goodness of cops obscures the truth of what needs to be done to fix the system.”

    Having been in a prison, I saw dozens of examples where the guards–the police authority in this environment–operated exactly as the inmates do, targeting some, giving privileges to others, and abusing their authority to manipulate the environment to their specific liking. In an insular environment like a prison, it’s glaring, but in society, it happens with similar regularity.

    Until this mentality is confronted, until the 70 percent in the middle are challenged and expected to do something different, the abuse and corruption will continue. So, too, will the protests and uproar.

    Ever the savvy politician, Brown knows where the real change must begin: the media, that fails daily in its call to shine light into the dark places of society. Too often the media has focused on black vs. white, or the immediacy of a protest, while avoiding its calling to offer deeper, accurate perspective of root causes. It fails to focus on the correct issue.

    So let’s repeat it once more. Maybe it will stick:
    > “This time the media should go where the dialogue needs to be, and that’s the cop mentality, something we’ve never really dealt with in this country.”

  title: The complicated, human story of Ray Jasper’s final statement
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Ray Jasper was a teenager the night he went with two friends and participated in the killing of a man he later testified “was the nicest man I’d ever met.”

    Jasper now sits on death row. He is set to be executed in Texas, a state notorious for its use of the death penalty, on March 19. Gawker wrote to Jasper and asked him to write about his thoughts. Jasper responded and wrote [a lengthy letter](http://gawker.com/a-letter-from-ray-jasper-who-is-about-to-be-executed-1536073598)… fully aware they were likely the last public statement he’d make on Earth. It’s hard to read this knowing this man will be executed in less than two weeks, which is exactly why you should read it.

    But I don’t write about this case to wade into the death penalty debate. I’ve made that clear before: if one innocent man is wrongly killed (and there is no “if” that it has happened and will happen again) then we need to abolish it. We need to find a different way as a society to deal with the horror of violence. I believe that every person can be rehabilitated. Many won’t, but the potential is there and we are at our best as a society when we strive for our ideals.

    Forget all that right now, especially if you’ve taken the time to read Ray Jasper’s “final statement on Earth.” Instead, I encourage you to put down the debate right now, stop choosing sides. Step outside of “you” and just be with the pain, retrospect, dignity and humanity within this terrible situation. Just experience it.

    Consider this part:
    > I’m on death row and yet I didn’t commit the act of murder. I was convicted under the law of parties. When people read about the case, they assume I killed the victim, but the facts are undisputed that I did not kill the victim. The one who killed him plead guilty to capital murder for a life sentence. He admitted to the murder and has never denied it. Under the Texas law of parties, they say it doesn’t matter whether I killed the victim or not, I’m criminally responsible for someone else’s conduct. But I was the only one given the death penalty.

    What Jasper says factually is true. What he omits is he drew the first knife, slicing across the throat of the victim, David Mendoza Alejandro. He reportedly planned the robbery and the violence involved.

    Despite this, Jasper’s letter is filled with humanity, thoughtfulness, resolve and dignity that he clearly did not learn until after he helped murder David Alejandro.

    So take a moment and consider the other side. [Read](http://steven-alejandro.kinja.com/hello-steven-thank-you-for-sharing-your-story-we-migh-1536840701) the thoughtful, human, dignified commentary from David’s brother, Stephan Alejandro:
    > During the trial, testimony from the Medical Examiner revealed that it was not technically Jasper’s injury to David that caused death, but the subsequent 25 stab wounds. Jasper’s defense team seized upon this as a defense tactic against a murder charge, and Jasper joined that opinion. Never mind that Jasper delivered the first attack. At one point while he was on the stand testifying, he asked to speak to us— David’s family members. He looked us square in the eye and exclaimed ‘I didn’t kill your son. He was one of the nicest guys I ever met, but I did not kill him.’ Jasper’s reasoning was that since the M.E. cited the 25 stab wounds as the cause of death and not the throat slit committed by Jasper, he was technically not guilty of murder. You can make of that what you will, but it seems any reasonable person would hold Jasper as culpable in the murder as the other defendant who finished off David. So the long and short of this final statement is based in a fantasy that Jasper has convinced himself of. All evidence to the contrary, it seems he denies he is a murderer and therefore he feels he should not be executed for the crime.

    Stephan admits he is against the death penalty. He avoided that specific testimony during the sentencing hearing to determine if Jasper would be executed. He writes in clear fashion that conflict he felt, but he testified that his brother did believe in the death penalty.

    “I’ll never know for sure, but it’s a pretty good bet David’s words uttered through me sealed Ray Jasper’s fate,” he wrote.

    He remains hurt by Jasper, especially Jasper’s refusal to admit he directly contributed to the death of a truly decent man. Who wouldn’t be? But more impressively, who would offer such a reasoned, clear and thoughtful defense of what he view as a mere publicity stunt by Jasper, rather than just lash out in hurt and anger?

    I think back to Jasper’s truly insightful comments on “empathy.” I hope someone sends him the comments written by his victim’s brother. I hope he finds it within himself to extend empathy in a way he hasn’t yet fully considered, according to Stephan Alejandro.

    Likewise, Stephan said he likely won’t read Jasper’s “final statement.” I wish he would. I can’t imagine how painful that might be, but it might help too. Empathy is a powerful healer.

    My thoughts collide noisily within me like pounding surf as I read these two starkly different, yet strikingly similar letters from both attacker and bereaved. I am profoundly grateful both men wrote. I’m profoundly sad for all the loss from this senseless violence. I am simply stuck with this story and all its attendant emotion.

    I can only think of one thing that’s clear: the humanity.

    And for me, that’s enough to build on for meaningful, thoughtful, temperate, compassionate reform.

    Justice, yes… but remember, justice and mercy are almost always paired together in the ancient scriptures. When both are prevalent, God is near.

    many times do you hear the cliché, “If I can just help one person ____ [fill in

    become rich, learn what I learned, avoid the mistakes I made, come to Jesus, get
    off the streets, etc.\n\nSo many people say changing one life is worth the effort.
    \ But never is this more true — and more ignored, perhaps — than when it comes
    to the death penalty in America.  Just ask Tony Yarbough, an innocent man who
    lost 21 years of his life, his freedom, his future and nearly all hope the day
    his mother and sister were brutally murdered. Tony should have been grieving with
    family. Instead he stood accused, falsely accused.\n\nBut if that isn’t bad enough,
    re-read what Tony told the Daily News after his release. If New York had the death
    penalty… if this had been Texas or Virginia or many other places in America, the
    reality is Tony might be dead today, not free.\n\nIf “just one person” isn’t enough,
    how many wrongfully accused are in prison nationwide? We know that dozens of homicide

    case is a complicated one. I’ll be writing much more about this in the days to
    come. But what is not complicated is this fact: Clemons confession was coerced
    by police work so unethical a judge reviewing the case said, “There was shoddy
    police work almost beyond comprehension,” he said, adding: “when I said shoddy
    I meant they took a path of least resistance, closing an investigation early as
    it was the easiest thing to do,” according [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/new-witness-reggie-clemons-injury).\n\nThe
    judge ruled in Clemons favor that police suppressed evidence as well.\n\nThe argument
    about Clemons’ guilt or innocence continues. The very judge that ruled on his
    behalf expressed grave concern. But the fact remains that the trial to convict
    Clemons was fatally flawed, according to the judge’s findings. Yet Clemons remains
    on death row facing the death penalty.\n\nSee the moveon.org petition on Reggie’s
    behalf [here](http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/mo-doc-usdoj-independent).\n\nCriminal
    Justice Reform is a massive, industrialized economically driven complex that will
    take equally massive effort to fix. But some so-called “low-lying fruit” exists,

  title: 'Mother’s Day Hope: Treat addicts before its too late'
  author: 'Tyler''s Mother (_____ Hayes?) '
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The story of burying my son is not unique.  It’s the story of him stealing his dad’s prescription pain killers, then becoming addicted to opiates, arrested for heroin distribution (2010), choosing to live on the streets of Portland instead of following house rules, in and out of jail for parole violations, losing his job every time he was arrested and starting over when he got out two weeks later all the time sliding even deeper into his addiction.

    In the spring of 2013 the Multnomah County Department of Justice sent him to a six-month treatment program.  It was fabulous! He returned to the fantastic person we all knew him to be: no more stealing, lying, cheating.  He wanted so badly to get his life back and worked hard to obtain housing, a job and was on his way.

    But the addiction returned.  By the winter of 2013 he failed the housing’s drug test. He went back on the streets.  He was back in his addiction. This time it was worse than before, and between April and November 2014 he spent more time in jail than out. Three weeks in, two or so weeks out before a parole violation and back in for two or three weeks more.  In and out. When I didn’t hear from him, I checked the jail rosters to see where he was…  he was found dead, locked in a men’s bathroom.

    He died alone.

    No one even knew he left this earth until 24 hours later when a customer couldn’t use the remotely located bathroom.

    The system failed Tyler.  I failed Tyler.  We all tried, but in the end we all disastrously unsuccessful. The medical examiner said that his tolerance was lower than usual due to his jail-enforced sobriety and that he used a dose that he may have used in the past, but it was too much for him this time.

    The jails need *treatment* for the addicts they arrest.  They need to find housing for the inmates they release! This nation does not release even a dog from the pound unless it has a home. The homeless issue in Portland is epidemic. The heroin issue in Portland is epidemic.  They go together.

    Tyler was not a saint.  But he was loved.  And I miss him terribly.

    At Ty’s memorial I invited all of his people.  They stood up and talked of how amazing he was.

    I saw Tyler the night before he died.  He had the opportunity to get into another treatment program, and he said no, he was “going to do this (recovery) on his own,” and that he wanted to stay on the streets and talk to the people about “the love of God, and how God loves you even in your addiction.”

    I’m afraid I wasn’t very supportive of this.  I told Ty that he needed to get into his own recovery before he could help anyone else. His last words to me were “Mom, I thought you would be more supportive of me with this.  I am telling people about the love of my God.”

    So there.  Even in the deepest, darkest places, my son was trying to tell people about God’s love.  It was my heroin addicted son’s last commission.

    In my opinion, saddest part of Ty’s story, strangely enough, is not his death. But his struggle to get out of the addiction. He hated it. After he passed his friends spoke to me about how much he hated it. Once, during detox, he laid his head on my lap and cried, vomited, cried again saying over and over how he “just wanted his life back.”

    He said that the first time he used the drug someone told him to be careful, that heroin will take you farther than you want to go, cost you more than you want to pay and keep you longer than you want to stay.

    As Mother’s Day approaches I think more about those times, my work with NarAnon, Ty’s treatment, family counseling, but mostly I think about the time he went to a friend’s Pentecostal Church retreat for youth. Ty had someone lay hands on him and spoke “vision” that Ty would use his charismatic gifts to lead the lost to Christ, that he would be a light where there wasn’t any to be found.

    I always thought Ty would discover the magic of the ever elusive “recovery” and would use his hard gained knowledge of the dark to shine the light of faith, love and hope.

    I thought we had more time.

    ----

    *Eds. note: A friend from the past dropped me a note through our contact page. I remembered her as a young mom of two sons who seemed to never tire and never stop being thrilled with her rambunctious boys. So her email knocked the wind out of me to consider one of those young boys (now a 29 year-old man named Tyler Hayes) had died of a heroin overdose just a few months ago. Her gift to everyone is the story of her son as she seeks to move beyond her own grief. And so we dedicate our efforts to show the need for treatment of addiction, not criminalization. We urge people to recognize, it isn’t about second chances, but as many chances as it takes to help a person recover from the terrible disease of addiction. We honor Tyler Hayes, because even addicts like us have a positive impact on those around us. We are all worthy of love.*

  title: Show children of inmates a different way
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Of the thousands of things I learned about myself during my time enrolled at Criminal U, two things usually bubble up to the top of the list. 1) Alcohol fueled my recklessness, which in every way contributed to my enrollment at Criminal U. 2) By doing acts of service (12th step in AA) I stay sober, which diffuses my recklessness. It’s a simple formula, one that I found works for me.

    The process started long before graduation. I began doing what I could. That was it. Nothing much. When you make about .35 cents an hour, you can’t give much money. When you’re movements are limited by barbed wires and bars, you can’t do much for others outside the bars. So I simply got with God and said that when things came up, I’d do what I could.

    Inside, all around you, needs are evident. But any act of kindness or service can be misconstrued into an act of extortion or manipulation or even weakness. Service to others at Criminal U isn’t easy. Still I resolved to do what I can.

    Soon a  flow of opportunities presented themselves, things that I now see built the foundation for CriminalU. I learned a letter, handwritten, could break into the morass of demands and obligations for someone and brighten their day — even one with barely legible script as my own. I learned taking the time to simply listen could infuse someone who feels hopeless with a sense of hope.

    Most importantly, within me it built a spirit of cooperation and willingness that improved my outlook on service. I found myself trying to say yes, instead of saying no.

    I mentioned the 12th step so let me digress just a moment. Yes, I did the 12 steps and still practice those principles every day. The 11th step — Daily Moral Inventory — is one of the most important aspects of discipline in my day. But it would be easy here to say, “hey what about steps 8 and 9… the whole making amends…” and be right. I have years of making amends ahead of me. Years. A lifetime probably. I have a list… a really, really long list of amends I hope to make as I can. The steps are about practicing them, not mastering or completing them. I had to accept that I am committed to amends, even if many who most deserve it won’t see any evidence of it for some time, then progressed through the steps knowing this work is not done.

    Anyway, back to the story. On my last day inside hours before I was to be released I was asked to do a favor. Had I not been practicing the idea of doing what I could I would have never agreed. This simple decision gave more to me than I gave that day.

    The favor was for a brother of a dear friend. My friend and her husband had been among my most faithful visitors. I’d do most anything for them. The opportunity to prove that came most unexpectedly, when my friend’s brother showed up hours before my release. He wanted to interview me on video for an outreach program.

    There were three problems: 1) I wanted to go home, I wasn’t thinking about all this right now. 2) The interview would take me back to those early days, the days I left my family behind and became nearly impotent as a father, days I’d lived out in dark lonely nights behind bars far too often. 3) He was a police officer.

    I have to admit. Four years at Criminal U had taught me well the barriers between inmates and police. They wear grey, we wear blue and the two sides interact similar to those in blue and grey about 150 years ago, in what we now call the Civil War. So moments before I went home I really didn’t want to sit down with a cop.

    I weighed all this against one thing on the other side of the scale. I had resolved to do what I could, and I could do this. I agreed.

    The interview lasted a good 90 minutes. We delved into various topics and rehashed old raw nerves. At one point the Lt. and I engaged in a healthy give-and-take (I thought it was off-camera. I was wrong!) about the prison industry’s mass epidemic of incarceration. We had different opinions as one might expect. We listened to each other.

    The dialogue led to my daughter volunteering to interviewed as well. Eventually these interviews will be part of an educational video for children of incarcerated adults. One thing the Lt. convinced me of was the most likely way to reduce prison populations is to capture the children of inmates before they become inmates themselves. This group… our kids… have the highest risk of being jailed than any other segment of the population. It’s a sad legacy we bequeath.

    I graduated from Criminal U that day with a new focus of service moving forward. I would do whatever the Lt. ever asked of me for this outreach for the children of inmates. We’ve emailed since my release. A bridge now exists across the gap of our blue and grey differences. He’s shared some interesting perspectives that challenge my notions about prison reform. He has respectfully heard my views. It’s a start.

    In the end, we can only do what we can. So I continue those first steps of service. I do what I can.

  title: Watch Night chimes in freedom with new year
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    In some parts of the country Watch Night means something about a Rolex, I’m sure. But in others, in deep south churches, or strong African-American communities like Cleveland and [Cocoa, Florida](http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20131229/STYLE/312290016/Watch-Night-prayers-usher-new-year-Cocoa), Watch Night means one thing: Freedom.

    Booker T. Washington chronicled the first Watch Night back on Jan. 1 1863, when folks gathered in churches all over the south to await the first chimes of freedom as the clock struck midnight.

    “As the day grew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual.  It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted longer into the night. True, they had sung those same verses before, but they had been careful to explain that the ‘freedom’ in these songs referred to the next world, and had no connection with life in this world. Now they gradually threw off the mask; and were not afraid to let it be known that the ‘freedom’ in their songs meant freedom of the body in this world.”

    The year of freedom. As the [African American Registry](http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/first-watch-night-service-occurs) pointed out, “When the news was received, there were prayers, shouts and songs of joy as many people fell to their knees and thanked God.”

    That’s what was celebrated 151 years ago, even though the long road to freedom has continued apace ever since, even to this New Year’s Eve, where many, many people still live under oppression.  For many, the bars are of their own creation — cells of addiction, bankruptcy, relational distress, moral failure — but for others the same principles of servitude apply. Injustice still enslaves many, as does prejudice against those who have made past mistakes. An epidemic of incarceration that has profited a few while locking up millions contributes to a deep need and yearning for freedom. A century and a half has come and gone and the horrors of institutionalized slavery have been outlawed, but the basic human need to live lives that are free remains.

    Watch Night is a celebration, but it’s also a service of worship to a God of love that proclaimed the year of Jubilee — freedom– for all upon His coming.

    Like those Booker T. Washington observed that first Watch Night long ago, the choice remains ours alone: Will we sing the songs of freedom along the way, or we will we remain in bondage to our past?

    Let freedom ring tonight. Let freedom ring.

  title: Bush Second Chance Act lacks impact upon prison officials
  author: Halim Flowers
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    > "Government has a responsibility to help prisoners to return as contributing members of their community. In other words, we’re standing with you, not against you.” George W. Bush at the signing of the Second Chance Act on April 9, 2008

    Anyone that has been to prison knows that even though this was a noble statement spoken by President Bush, it is not the practice of the Federal Bureau of Prisons nor State Department of Corrections. The prison system has given up hope of its own ability to rectify the social ills of criminals in America. It quietly shifted to a “no-rehabilitation/solely punishment” policy within corrections. Even minors are given more life sentences in the United States than any country in the world.

    President Bush spoke at the annual State of the Union address in January 2004 and said that people in prison should return to society better than when they went in. Thus, the name “Second Chance” originated with Bush’s speech and grew to become the Sceond Chance Act signed by the president near the end of his time in office.

    I recently read about this in *Beyond Bars: Rejoining Society After Prison* by Jeffery Ross and Stephen Richards. I thought about how so many people talk so badly about Bush’s presidency, but not many prisoners even know or remember that he led the effort for prisoner rehabilitation.

    For example, Bush supported prisoner rehabilitation and spiritual development with the “Life Connections” religious-based program that he initiated within the FBOP to link inmates of different faiths with mentors of their shared theology in society.

    I know most citizens that have never been to prison before do not know — or may do not even care –about prisoners and the state of corrections. However, you all pay taxes for this system and the staff whose salaries you pay have a duty and responsibility to assure that their wards do not return to society to plague your communities with violent or non-violent offenses. They have taken an oath and have been given directives to “correct” and better the human beings that they are paid to detain; hence, department of “corrections.”

    Most prisoners want to become something greater than a criminal, but when the people that are supposed to be employed to assist successful transition into society are indifferent and condescending towards inmates. Often inmates become frustrated with the corrections process and give up hope in the midst of their anger. I’m not advocating that felons receive any favors; I only ask that prison staff and members of society do their part to fulfill the vision of President Bush and stand with us and not against us.

    Is that too much to ask?

  title: New Earth crushes school-to-prison pipeline in L.A.
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    It is time to shed light on an unacceptable unspoken fact that lies in the belly beneath the surface of awareness in Los Angeles. As of July 2014, there are roughly 30,000 young people on probation or locked up in L.A. County, more than any other metropolitan area in the world. Ninety-five percent of these youth face incarceration for nonviolent offenses. Once a young person enters this school-to-prison pipeline, 86% will end up incarcerated again. This system is broken and its rehabilitation depends upon the deployment of revolutionary tactics and a new way of thinking.

    Fortunately, New Earth, a non-profit started in 2003, is reducing the recidivism rate in Los Angeles by providing mentor-based arts, educational and vocational programs to incarcerated and formerly incarcerated youth ages 13-22. Their programs empower these youth’s lives, enabling them to reach full potential as contributing members of their community.

    New Earth’s programs have an incredible success rate. Once a youth starts a New Earth program, his chance of getting re-incarcerated drops down from 86% to less than 5%. They damn up the school-to-prison pipeline and completely divert those young adults into channels that give them back hope and a life of meaning.

    “Our goal is to reduce the recidivism rate in Los Angeles and keep these kids from coming back to the camps, going to prison or worse yet, becoming a statistic,” explains Harry Grammer, Founder and CEO of New Earth.

    The school-to-prison pipeline costs taxpayers dearly.

    It costs taxpayers $150,000 per year to lock up one youth, however it takes a mere $3,500 to put one young person through the New Earth programs for an entire year. Youth remain free from gangs, crime and jail – they’re kept inspired, productive and ALIVE. Today, New Earth serves 2,500 young people per year in nine out of the 18 juvenile probation camps in Los Angeles County. They work with more incarcerated youth in L.A. than any other non–governmental organization.

    “New Earth has changed my life in many ways.” Alex Pham, 21, says. “It has changed the aspect of how I view the simplest things in life. The love, care, and appreciation the viewers have for the job I do is incredibly outstanding. It made me realize that we should appreciate more and be grateful for every little thing in life.”

    Pham is a program alumni who now works at the New Earth offices as a camera operator for Explore.org.

    The road to change within the historically harsh and unjust industrial prison system is one with deep rooted complexities, but New Earth’s programs are a firm step in the direction of repair and life-changing retribution.

    When we launched Inside Innovations, one statistic shot across the night sky of this dark epidemic of America’s industrialize prison economy. This one stats shows the oppressive, life altering reality of the system we built. “Eighty-six percent of those incarcerated under the age of 18 will return to prison. Nearly nine in ten.”

    But here’s the second statistic that sounded the alarm bell for us: “More than 40 percent of all young men in America — white men, Hispanic men, Black men, any kind of man — would end up with some type of criminal contact with police before the age of 23.”

    Nearly half of all men end up the system. Many of those end up in prison, their lives radically re-directed from pipelines of productivity into the school-to-prison pipeline that educates within the barbed wire and walls of Criminal U. Once there, the vast majority are doomed. They will forever be a burden on society.

    But where the numbers don’t lie that these young men were doomed, the Tipping Point of public awareness and the innovative efforts like New Earth suggest those dramatic statistics are changing.

    We didn’t have our ducks in a row, and we didn’t have any money, and we don’t know for sure if we have a solution, but Inside Innovations offers hope to break that pipeline, so we launched. The effort continues with interest in major urban areas like Chicago, Jackson, Miss., Houston, Texas, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Oakland and Portland, Ore. The movement continues.

    Which is exactly why we are championing the effort at New Earth today. Every good effort to change this hopeless track of the mass incarceration and criminal education of the next generation of young men in this country is needed. Every oar in the water against the tide of the school-to-prison pipeline is essential. And New Earth? Well, it’s a big, big oar.

    They are making a dramatic impact in the heart of the problem, in the middle of the vast landscape of Los Angeles where more young people are incarcerated than anyone place in America.

    Join the movement today. Help New Earth spread hope and channel LA youth back into pipelines of productivity. Here’s how:

    Every other month, New Earth hosts an Awareness Mixer for anyone to attend to encourage dialogue about this huge problem in Los Angeles and discuss ways to make a difference for LA Youth. Additionally, their Expression Monday events create a window into the paths which are forged through the inner-workings of their programs and attendees. [Check out their website](http://www.newearthlife.org/) for more info on their program and events.

    Attend the next New Earth Awareness Mixer:
    WHEN: Thursday Oct 30th, 5:30pm -7:30pm

  title: 'Rule #23: Embrace the mystery'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "I know when my wife is reading a good book. About a third
    of the way through I’ll see her sneaking looks to the last chapter.  I stuns me
    when I see her do it.\n\n“You’re ruining the ending,” I’ll say.\n\n“How?” she’ll
    ask. “It doesn’t change. I want to know what happens.”\n\nI’ve tried to explain
    the idea of suspense and the author’s desire to build tension. I’ve nagged a bit
    about the art of storytelling. She listens but is undeterred. She still cheats
    looks to the back, especially when a book is good, when the story is doing it’s
    job and the suspense grows.\n\nMy wife’s reading habits illustrate how many of
    us try to live life. As the tension builds, as the weight of our unknowing stirs,
    we try to sneak a peak at the ending so we can have all the answers, despite the
    fact that the greatest mystery ever continues to his day. We don’t know how this
    thing called life ends. We can’t know the ending; we can only learn to embrace
    the mystery itself rather than think we have it solved.\n\nBut our deep yearning
    to know, to circumvent the suspense, leads to any number of experts, soothsayers,
    prophets, preachers and truth peddlers waiting to seize on our existential anxiety.
    Beware.\n\nBeware of those with religious certitude. History has shown them to
    be capable of the worst of atrocities. Instead, seek God. Be a disciple (a learner)
    until you’re dying days. Be a sojourner. Our destination on our spiritual journey
    does not occur on this side. Answers will come on the other side.\n\nIf you think
    about it carefully, *by definition* God can’t be fully understood nor explained.
    If we humans could do that, we’d be God. I’ve known plenty of people. I’ve liked
    some and even loved a few. But, I’d never want any of them to be God. I wouldn’t
    even vote for me. God needs to far surpass us mere humans to hold the job or their
    would be nothing Godlike about her. Hence, our limitations. Hence, the mystery.\n\nWhy
    fight it? God lives in a world that far surpasses our three-dimensional reality,
    so on each dimension he exists that we don’t, we see only a mystery. We lack the
    hooks to hang such knowledge.\n\nFor example, let’s pretend we are a God of a
    two dimensional world. Everything is flat. These pancake people are swell. They
    love us, the Gods, even though the can only see our feet. Everything they interpret
    about us is what they can see on their two dimensional plane. So one day they
    see me jump. The smartest, esteemed 2_D religious leaders gather together to interpret
    “God.” After much discussion, they state a new religious truth: God can become
    invisible. That’s how “truth” would look to pancake people, even though truth
    is really we simply needed exercise. That’s how it is with us 3D people and our
    God. Those who don’t accept that scare me a little.\n\nNew Testament Scholar N.T.
    Wright writes about how we see God not as a perfect portrait but more like abstract
    art.  The essence is there but it can be hard to fully make out. He uses the example
    of signposts that help point us through the fog.\n\nWhen I read scriptures and
    read about the Apostle Paul, I see a guy fairly comfortable with his certitude.
    But he even describes life as a mystery. He said we see God through a dark glass,
    not crystal clear.\n\nThis can be frustrating to people who are determined to
    have all the answers or feel like their job is provide all the answers. I understand
    it, but I don’t have a ton of sympathy. Know-it-alls are a particularly grating
    species anyway but even more so when it comes to something so incomprehensible
    as God. It doesn’t have to be so scary. The mystery, the unknowing, can be something
    besides frustrating. In fact, it can be freeing!\n\nConsider for a minute all
    the cool things it would be absolutely wonderful to be wrong about.  For example,
    the biggie: hell. What if all this religious certainty about hellfire and damnation
    turned out to be more metaphor instead of reality. We know our language comes
    up short in defining these spiritual mysteries we can’t really see. It seems possible,
    dare I say likely, that our limited vocabulary to explain the other side of this
    life we can’t fully imagine makes our best efforts a bit like my well-meaning
    but ignorant pancake people? Just the possibility breeds humility that is often
    in short supply when it comes to such discussions. And what if were so? We all
    get to this thing called heaven.\n\nSounds good to me.\n\nFrustrating? Perhaps,
    but maybe more so freeing. Consider that well-trod verse John 3:16.  If God really
    so loves the world that he came to save it, maybe, just maybe, he fully intend
    to save every last little bit of it: every last lovingly created animal, vegetable
    and mineral on this great miraculous green planet we call home, no matter how
    screwed up we became on this arduous journey we call life.\n\nYes, sounds very
    good to me.\n\nI think about this when I consider the spurious argument against
    global warming, for example. What if the right-wingers are right and its nothing
    but an Al Gore-inspired conspiracy to get us to treat the planet better and buy
    more efficient appliances. Well, OK. Sounds good to me. What’s the harm in that?\n\nI
    think about all the things we may well be wrong about in religious circles (or
    at least I hope so), things like wealth, homosexuality, women, discipline, and
    so many other abuses that have occurred in the name of God. Slavery is another
    that comes to mind that once had ardent religious support.\n\nI think about fun
    things I hope we are wrong about. I know Jesus cryptically said there would be
    no marriages in heaven, but I like to believe we misunderstood the greater meaning.
    Heaven for me seems a little less perfect without my bride. I’d rather just embrace
    the mystery and wait and see. \n\nLikewise, being the romantic that I am, I have
    always quietly cheered for the *Da Vinci Code* theory that Jesus actually married
    Mary Magdalene. Sure there isn’t much historical or theological support, but I
    still like the idea. I resonate with a God who still lived life fully and experienced
    first-hand the delirious and infuriating bliss that comes with true love. Mary
    was the first one the Risen Lord saw that first Easter after all. I like the priority
    of that. The disciples and the work could wait for love.\n\nlf these peddlers
    for truth have all the answers (and it really is worth killing over to decide
    which ONE is right), what’s the need for faith? I want a religion of faith. In
    faith I can require of myself more purity and honesty. Do I believe, do I love
    because of what’s given to me, or what I believe is to come as well? It’s far
    more like true love, which happens to be what I think God wants most of all. I’m
    like Her in that way. It makes me happy. I like faith. When I embrace the mystery,
    my faith grows. My love is more sincere, less selfish. So I defend the mystery.\n\nPractically,
    embracing the mystery saves me a lot of grief. I don’t need to fight as many battles
    to be right, whatever that means. In a world where violence from clashing religious
    certitude threatens any and all lasting peace, I’d welcome more humility, more
    questions, fewer answers and more faith. Terrorism today, the crusades of yester
    year, the persecution of the early church…how much violence have people done to
    each other to deny the basic mystery of faith?\n\n“Let faith oust fact, let fancy
    oust memory, I look deep down and do believe,” Melville wrote in *Moby Dick*.\n\nIt’s
    like the old nun in the book *Cutting for Stone*, who looked over the grave of
    an adored nun, and the devastation her death caused. She wonders if all their
    life work will continue. She’s in turmoil. Then suddenly she brightens. She says
    “I don’t see it Lord. But I do believe.”\n\nAnd that’s embracing the mystery."

  title: "‘Safety and Security’ sneaky, abused trump card for DOC"
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    When it comes to prison standards, “Safety and Security” trumps all.  A recent case before the Supreme Court showed just how powerful it can be.

    The case centers on an Arkansas prisoner, a Muslim, who has not been allowed to grow a beard because of the so-called “safety and security of the institution.”

    You can’t spend any time among Corrections officials without hearing this phrase. It’s the trump card. They roll it out to excuse or rationalize any decision where it might fit. An example: In several states politicians began looking for easy points with voters by lamenting “soft” prisons complained about inmates having TVs in their cells. The “debate” didn’t last long. Superintendents simply said it was a non-negotiable issue because of the “safety and security of the institution.” What does a TV have to do with security? In this case a lot, actually. Inmates vegging out in their cells watching hours of TV don’t run amok in the yard or get into fights over shared TVs in day rooms.

    But in other circumstances the issue is less clear.  For example, strip searches are ubiquitous in virtually every prison or jail in America. They are constantly employed, often for a variety of reasons. The idea is to stop smuggling. But in reality, as documented twenty years ago in a stellar book [The Hot House](http://www.amazon.com/The-Hot-House-Inside-Leavenworth/dp/0553560239), guards know they don’t truly work that well. What they do is dehumanize the inmates and put them in a state of embarrassment. It puts the guards in a place of ultimate power, demanding you undress and submit to a degrading inspection that is little more than a formality.

    “Bend over a cough,” guards demand, though few pay the least bit of attention.

    It’s little more than a power play, but one no DOC would even consider relenting on because of the… you got it… “safety and security of the institution.”

    Meanwhile a litany of contraband makes its way inside most every prison in America through numerous ways, including the still most popular “Keistering” the very thing the strip search is supposed to catch.  Shouldn’t a safety and security measure of such importance need to show demonstrable proof it actually works?

    I’ve seen the Safety and Security Trump Card used to deny yoga twice a week instead of just once and to deny a volunteer willing to create a running program for one prison that was exactly they same as one they had at a prison two miles away.

    It especially defends abusive treatment of inmates who are often powerless to speak out for fear of harsh treatment, frivolous and targeted discipline or even transfer to other facilities. Guards have power, tremendous power. Inmates are mostly powerless. To some extent such control is necessary and the genuine safety and security of an institution is so important that it should be held to highest standards. Instead, it’s used in cases like apparent discrimination as the Supreme Court case above, or in untold hundreds of ways that break the rehabilitative cycle with a dehumanizing and frustrating inconsistency that suggests that often those in power are convinced they are above the responsibility and accountability such power dictates.

    The abuse of this so-called trump card actually diminishes its intended goal. Routinely.

    Prison reform needs to start here. Right at the center of it all, a target with a bulls-eye that says “Safety and Security of the Institution.” Whenever the term is employed it should not stifle conversation, but enhance it. The burden of proof should he higher, not lower. Accountability should increase, rather than evaporate like mist as it does now.

    Consistent and effective measures of the safety and security of the institution sets the stage for all other manner of cultural changes within the prison environment that will break the cycle of mass incarceration, recidivism and abuse.

  title: Two days inside a lab of futility for neuroscientist
  author: Mani Scienide
  contentAboveNewsletter: |2-

    > Eds. note: Dr. Mani Scienide joined Criminal U as an adviser to work with inmates on developing emotional intelligence for life after the barbed wires and bars.

    Years of education at the finest schools in America like Harvard University, did little to prepare for me for two days inside Criminal U. But those two days made me a believer in the need for comprehensive criminal justice reform, which is why I’m joining the effort here.

    My name is Dr. Mani Scienide. I am a neuroscientist, a graduate from UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine, followed by an intense Psychiatry residency at University of Miami (the busiest psychiatric trauma center in the United States).

    At several points during my undergraduate pre-med research in psychology and during medical school, I did work in communities for people who were homeless and/or institutionalized (jail and psychiatric units). During that time I felt that the emphasis (western approach) was in pathologizing and labeling patients for medication.

    I often felt that patients and inmates were being put in a one-size-fits all model that did not honor the neurodiversity.

    Having gone through Harvard and in the pipeline for medical education and psychiatric training, I had a limited perspective on what real-life stressors and psycho-biological factors would be like.

    I had spent most of my life with a career plan and sense of direction already laid out and a road map. I therefore did not have the point of view to appreciate the stories many of my patients were sharing with me.

    I decided to take the time to understand and experience what my patients were going through by gaining life experience in the different perspectives — from dealing with the stress of a job outside of the secure world of medicine as well as experiencing the life of people on the side of society where they were constantly devalued and made to feel like outsiders in their own environment.

    I wanted to better understand what those trapped in the incarceration situation without as much insight or self esteem, sense of hope, empowerment or financial means go through.

    I was able to get a first-person view of the experiences that I knew to have psychological conditioning effects and gain a better understanding of the measures that would be necessary to rebuild the sense of identity and self efficacy as well as provide the cognitive restructuring crucial for a successful transition back into functional society.

    Every person who experiences the intense psychological assault of arrest will experience changes to sense of self and the behavioral conditioning that takes place in institutionalized environments.

    I was also able to hear the stories from an insider candid view and see the relationship dynamics that lead to inmates feeling the compulsion to return to prison after a short period outside. I better understand this cycle of recidivism that comes due to failing to develop a sense of belonging and the inability to see the social opportunities. I understood the narratives that the inmates identified with and the impact of day to-day living with warrants and the threat of arrest and financial hardship.

    When put under extraordinary stress, an individual will have what in Jungian psychology we call the primitive, shadow functioning, using our underdeveloped mental functions. Looking at prison gangs, homeless populations and those trapped in the grip of addiction and social maladaptation, we can clearly see that these individuals have child-like, amygdala-driven reactionary behaviors. If you address the stress-induced polarity shift of mental functions, you will expect that these behaviors will be replaced with their adaptive higher functions and reflective responses. When this occurs the individual would then be able to learn and adapt.

    Now, I feel like I have a better plan to help those graduating Criminal U find the emotional intelligence necessary to succeed.

    By recognizing the narratives and honoring the neurodiversity, we have an opportunity to harness the talent, creative energy, and desire for self actualization that is in that population. We can take what is often seen manifested as aggressive energy and redirect that frustration into passion for productive contribution to society.

    By providing a person with an entrepreneur’s identity, he she can find a place to fit into productive society while being intrinsically motivated by self actualization and the natural human drive to be his best self.

    I shifted from a focus on symptoms to a focus on prime causes.

    For example, I don’t just want to help someone who is stressed out by prescribing anti-anxiety medication, I want to discover why they respond to stress the way they do, and how to pinpoint the solution.  I want to provide the individual with tools and skills that will be propagated to his offspring, family members, and close relationships. Since humans learn through mimicry, this is the best model for spreading to a community a mindset of productivity and healthy individuation.

    Criminal U is doing exciting things to challenge the epidemic of mass incarceration in America and to break the endless cycle of recidivism. It’s exciting to join the effort and be part of a truly innovative solution.

  title: Three cheers to the last of holidays inside
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    As this Holiday season — my first free in five years — winds down, I find myself reflecting often on those still inside. I welcome 2014 for all its resplendent possibility. But the tails of the coin to that heads is an awareness of all that I left behind, back inside the barbed wires and bars.

    I’ve thought about the holidays I spent in there. I’ve thought about those I know still spending them in there. As I’ve written to the them or taken their calls, I’ve told those getting out in 2014 the same thing: “If you do this right, this is the last time you’ll spend the holidays in there.”

    This thought remains such a prominent part of my life. I pay attention to things with a heightened sense of awareness to ensure I’ll never go back. The memories stay with me, whether I like them or not. The dreams remain soiled by the experience.

    I dreamt of prison last night. I often do. It’s strange in that when I was in prison I rarely dreamt of life outside. I rarely escaped in those night hours to freedom. But now that I’m out, I often dream I’m back. The experiences are too real. I’m still doing time.

    I woke up this morning needing to shake off the night and to remind myself I am free. My memories rolled back to the time when I wasn’t. I recalled my first Christmas inside, locked in an ancient cell at the state pen. On Christmas Eve a commotion stirred the cell block as orderlies and guards passed out little brown bags of treats to the inmates one cell at a time. My cellie and I waited, hearing the chatter about candies and fruit. When the orderly passed by our cell, he shrugged.

    “Ran out, I’ll go get more,” he said, barely pausing to see us or let us see him.

    We all knew what had happened. He’d slipped his “homeboys” extra. Now we were out. There would be no more.

    “We don’t even get coal this year,” I said to my cellie.

    He rolled over and returned to watching TV. We could get upset and take it out to the yard, but we both knew it wasn’t worth it. This was life inside.

    Life isn’t meant to be lived with such indifference. But our attempts at combating rampant recidivism have been disastrous. Two-thirds of those inside will return. Few can truly say they’ll never go back. Never say never, most inmates will say. All we can do is live mindfully, focused with heightened awareness on the traps that exist and the riptide like pull that tugs at your legs as you go in a different direction.

    I talked to the guys inside this week, and spent a bit more time with those getting out in 2014. I told them to be aware, to do everything they could now to prepare to be free. I encouraged them to be different, to be one of those who truly has spent their last holiday inside.

    That’s my wish this first day of 2014.

    Ayoe Jiboku reached out to hundreds — no exaggeration — of agencies, members of the media, advocates with a simple desire: To bring to light the abusive working environment of Alcatraz Cruises. None bothered to take it on. Most didn’t read the pages of documentation he offered. A few lawyers picked it over, looking for paydays. None acted. The abuses continued.

    Until finally [one newspaper](http://www.sfweekly.com/2014-05-14/news/alcatraz-cruises-hornblower-cruises-statue-of-liberty-cruises/) decided to do what that they are charged with: Holding those in power accountable. Shining light in the dark corners of society. Giving voice to the muted (nobody is voiceless if they don’t want to be, as Jiboku’s story illustrates).

    The SF Weekly was that newspaper. Criminal U first brought Jiboku’s story to light. Then we took it the next mile an investigated. SF Weekly agreed to run it.

    Today, many, many employees — far more than are represented in the story — have a reason to hope again.

    It’s what journalism — for all its bad name — is really about.

    Now is when the true power of social media can get to work. Jiboku’s petition simply demands the National Parks Service — which awards the multi-million dollar contract for services — conduct its own thorough investigation into the discrimination and intimidation that is rampant at Alcatraz Cruises.

    If Alcatraz Cruises was a college football program, the NCAA would have to consider the death penalty for the dreaded “lack of institutional control.” But because it’s a rapidly growing, PR-savvy company with a unique ability to garner high-profile contracts with various government authorities, its maltreatment of employees continues unabated. Those suffering the most appear to be employees of color stuck in mostly entry level positions who need the job the most.

  title: 'Reform’s first step: imagine non-profit prison'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I walked with my wife and our dogs down the street on a pleasant summer evening. She wanted me to explain how a prison could be called “for profit.” I explained it, like this:
    > Imagine a chain of three-star hotels that know if they fill 70 percent of the rooms every night they make a decent profit. Imagine how much more they make if they know they can have 95 percent occupancy every night. Then imagine how much more they make if they cut services to one-star quality and openly lie about that. Now imagine that nobody cares at all and keeps sending people to fill up the rooms.

    That’s for-profit prisons.

    She shook her head and wondered why governments could allow such a thing. Allow it I said, some states have tried to enter into contracts to ensure it, guaranteeing occupancy levels of 90 percent or above. Let that sink in: Our governments guarantee a certain number of occupants sent to for-profit prisons. Just what does that say about constitutional rights to fairness and justice?

    For-profit prisons are a sure bet, which explains why Wall Street continues to love for-profit corporations, which is nothing new, especially to the politicians and corrections officials who have most benefitted from the arrangement.

    A word about those “profits.” What’s the commodity being sold? Who is buying? Where do these profits come from? Taxpayers, of course. They aren’t “profits.” They are taxes, funneled to those who lobby the governments to ensure the money train keeps rolling.

    We continued our stroll, and the thought lingered in my mind. Why weren’t others as perplexed by the notion of “for-profit” prisons? Why isn’t it a misnomer instead of reality?

    And why hasn’t a non-profit prison been built yet? I stuck on that a while longer. A non-profit prison. The idea seems so unimaginable, it’s almost laughable, which says how brainwashed we all have become.  A public institution designed to correct human behavior–it is called the Department of Corrections, after all–is a profit-making institution to the extent that a non-profit  prison designed to do the same vital public service is nearly impossible to believe.

    Let’s imagine it differently.
    > Imagine a non-profit prison that works to empty its cells instead of fills them. Imagine the high, union-backed contracts and pension going to counselors instead of guards. Imagine a competitor of for-profit prisons that invested those “profits” to rebuild human beings instead of further dehumanizing them. Imagine a place that expects inmates to work toward their future the moment they arrive, with a simple goal of returning to society and contributing to it, rather than continuing the cycle of destructive cost.

    It is, for now at least, the misnomer.

    But that can change. Someone dreamed up the billion-dollar boondoggle that is the current American prison system. So we can also dream up a nonprofit prison that stands in stark contrast.

    Those most qualified to work on this are those who have been through the current system, the diversely talented group of alumni from Criminal U, who owe society for the harm they’ve caused.

    We can reform. We can rebuild the whole thing through competition and value for taxpayers. We can image this.

    Why don’t we?

  title: 'Protest this: Broken system breaks all within it'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    It is said a picture is worth a thousand words. Well the picture Saturday of maybe a hundred police lined in formation surrounding hundreds of protesters near the Ferry Building in San Francisco tells the story of today’s broken criminal justice system.

    The streets are flooded recently and this weekend’s The Millions March was even bigger than those days that proceeded it. Surrounding it was a police force that’s also super-sized. They turned out early, riot gear at the ready and surrounded the efforts before they even began.

    For those who have seen these battle lines and lived on them it was nothing new. But seeing it so obviously portrayed in public was new.

    Organized protests from The Capitol to the coast and at major cities from sea to shining seas spilled public venom and despair over a “public safety” system that puts the public — especially young black members of that public — in danger far too often.

    Admittedly these protests are a mess, violent, destructive and yet somehow still necessary. They are not a band of togetherness, but of competing values, from those looking simply to destroy, to others wanting to seize the spotlight for their cause, to police infiltrating undercover to disrupt, to those ardent pacifists who risk beatings to ensure the protests are done right, to those arguing about whether this is a white issue or a black issue instead of an American issue or a human issue.

    What are they protesting for, people ask. Body cameras on police. Murder sentences against police. To simply say we’re as mad as hell and we aren’t going to take it anymore.  Ask anyone and you’ll get these answers and many more.  The lack of unifying solution is part of the unwieldy nature of these protest. It is unfortunate because it allows too many to dismiss the protests over their uncontrolled and disparate methodology rather than carefully consider the pain that causes so many to spill out into the streets, night after night, blocking freeways and trains and businesses from proceeding normally.

    What are these protests about? Exactly that: Changing what has become normal. The normal we’ve come to accept is a militarized police force that increasingly destroys the citizens its sworn to protect. The normal we’ve come to protect is a criminal justice system that destroys rather than rehabilitates, so the solutions we offer are simply to throw the cops into the same broken system as well. Convict them. Charge them with murder. Give them what they’ve given us all these years.

    But here’s the thing that’s missing: Ask anyone who has been inside Criminal U for very long and they will tell you about the brokenness. They won’t just be talking about the inmates. The system is broken. And it breaks the people within it, even those who steadfastly defend it.

    As Criminal U correspondent Halim Flowers wrote me recently, “The marches are needed to raise awareness of brutality. What people must know as well is that the police brutality that they see with law enforcement is only a fraction of the unjust force that correctional officials administer daily to millions of American prisoners in these penal colonies. If they aren’t afraid to kill in the public eye then one can only imagine the recklessness that they possess behind the 80 foot walls and electric fences.”

    The energy of anger in the streets is necessary to bring about this conversation. But also necessary is leadership from within the system, from within the police force and from the activists who are leading this charge. Those who are inside the system — who have been a part of the problem through their crimes — must be part of the solution as well. The conversation needs to go broad, with listening at its center. The anger must give way to energy.

    The police culture is broken. It thrives on similar thinking, similar pressure, similar power that goes on with the inmates themselves in any correctional institution in this country. The system is so broken that people are objectified, both those that wear the badge and those that despite it. The system is so broken that police become hate filled and fearful, just like the inmates inside the system itself. The system is so bad that those with the badges and guns often are using those powerful tools to commit their own crimes likes rape, drug trafficking, intimidation, assault and even murder and yet often those who know it are afraid to police their own.

    Body cameras can’t fix that.

    Anyone who has been enrolled at Criminal U, we know what Halim writes about. But we also know our role. We’ve created the culture of indifference by our own mistakes. Somewhere blame must end and a culture of true reform must begin.

    As in everything that big, it starts small… within each of us, within me.

    May if flow outward from there.

  title: Jobs at ‘the root of the root’ for us all
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    When I was still enrolled in Criminal U, my daughter sent me a beautiful poem by e.e. Cummings. A line from it I’ll never forget. Not the well-known title (I carry your heart) but the line, “here is the root of the root…” which beautifully says: “the bottom line.”

    The bottom line right now for so many of those I love and support: Jobs. Here at the root of the root is a single source of empowerment that I’ve come to believe is the most critical step of a human being rebuilding his or her life. We need a roof, we need food. Maslow was right (to some extent) about his hierarchy. But we really, really need a job.

    I’ve worked since I was 15 and lied about my age to get a job at a local pizza parlor. I’ve worked two jobs most of my life, fueled by relentless ambition and an anxious mind that rarely slows down. I’ve never known how NOT to get a job.

    When I was first released on a transleave program from prison that offered a chance at early release, I was told I had 30 days to get a job or I’d be sent back to prison, despite being sent back to the same small town I committed my crimes in, where I had been a feature on the front page. I was beyond toxic. Still I had a job the day I got out writing for a website. My supervisors told me I couldn’t take it. Until I completed the 12-week transleave program I wouldn’t be allowed computer access. I got another job a week later, commission sales for a magazine. They said no good. It has to be hourly, not commission. I pedaled my bike 20 miles a day and dropped off more than a hundred applications in two weeks. Eventually I got a job: restocking beer alone in a 7-11 on a graveyard shift. They said OK to that job, but began setting up drug tests for me on a regular basis. I had just completed a six-month rehab program for alcoholism, so it’s safe to say, they were right to have their suspicions. Yet, I passed every test.

    I took for granted how easily I got jobs.  It isn’t easy anymore.

    I look around me and see the struggles of others and realize I am not alone. I hear of three million and growing desperately hoping for Congress to break the eight month log-jam over unemployment benefits and I know I am not alone. I read comments of scared people wondering how millionaire Congressmen can ignore their desperate need and I feel it too.

    My friend, Antonio Yarbough, freed after 21 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit can’t get a job in a big city like New York. He has no criminal history, but no work history either.  He wants to work. He’s spent decades waiting for the chance to work. Yet he can’t find a job.

    I know of a woman in Texas supporting her family alone while her husband is in prison who just recently lost her job. I feel her worry. She needs a job. I see my wife — who only lost her job because of my crimes — apply for jobs time and time again, get close only to not get the job. She needs a job. So so many of us do.

    We are not alone. I’ve seen so many inmates come out and struggle to find work. They think they are branded. What they don’t know is all around them are society’s unbranded people — good people, smart people, talented people — who need jobs just like them. Very little divides these branded and unbranded. Goodness, talent and smarts is evident in both. And desperation about a job is a common theme.

    At a recent family gathering I was made of aware of how virtually every person in the room was talking about their job and some sort of change that lay at the center of their concern. Even those most “successful” were considering new jobs. I scanned the room and thought about all those I love and those I try to help and myself and saw a very common theme: jobs.

    It’s the tie that binds.

    Few things are so meaningful as “you got the job.”

    I know a litany of people in places like New York, Houston, California and Oregon who need to hear that. Perhaps we can soon develop a job posting here on this site. Perhaps we can actually do something to lend a hand. Perhaps, we can help each other find those jobs we need.

    Perhaps.

    Here at the root of the root in this massive undertaking called life is this basic need.

  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    My wife showers me with compliments. I never grow tired of it. Of all the compliments she gives me, none make me so happy as when she tells me I make her laugh.

    Laughter is important to her. We’ve had some serious shit happen in our life and for a long time there just wasn’t much to laugh about. But the laughter never fully went away from either of us and it’s so much better when we are together.

    She’s always valued it. I think I took it for granted. Now I don’t, which leads me to this rule. Laughter has to be a part of your life if your life is worth living so Rule #18: Laugh until you cry.

    I stole this from the movie *The Bucket List*. I applaud the writers who correctly had this be the last item Morgan Freeman crosses off his list before he dies. He laughs until tears form. Then he’s ready to, as Melville wrote in *Moby Dick*, ”Launch into the region of the strange untried.”

    Laughter should fill your days. If you can laugh on the day you die, it’s been a pretty good life.

    Somehow a sense of humor has taken on a bad rap. Society is so serious. Only serious people earn promotions. How often have you seen the President of the United States bend over with laughter? Yet we’ve seen even the youngest of them turn grey before our eyes. They’re among the most photographed people in the world and we rarely see them laugh. It’s too bad, for them especially. I’d like a president who played fun practical jokes on the secret service men (talk about serious guys, right?).

    Remember Kevin Kline in the movie *Dave*? What that movie captured well is even a serious guy like the president makes a far bigger splash when he can laugh and make others laugh and take himself a bit less seriously.

    I’m struck by how laughter connects you with people,” says comedian and actor John Cleese. “It’s almost impossible to maintain any kind of distance or any sense of social hierarchy when you’re just howling with laughter. Laughter is a force for democracy.”

    Laughter has proven to be healing. It’s antibiotic for a wounded heart literally or figuratively. It reminds us of our youth when we danced, and skipped and hugged and cried and especially laughed.

    Whoever said laughter is the orgasm of the soul said it perfectly. After a wild, laugh until you cry episode you feel about as relieved, and about as pleasant as well.

    Cackle. Uproariously at times. Smile as often as you can. Laugh until you cry.

    This is the good life.

    She calls herself simply the “hat lady,” but I’ve learned Fathiyyah Muhammad’s far more than that.

    So imagine my surprise when the hat lady swooped into my world and added me to her special membership of chosen “best heads.” She also left a giddy smile that just seems plastered on my face whenever I think about her.

    Hold on, I’m getting ahead of myself. Before I tell you about me in this story, let me tell you all about the hero of the story, a Florida septuagenarian who enthusiastically touts “Only in America,” which is stitched into her hats.

    Muhammad tenaciously pursues famous people — five presidents have been personally given their hats and photographed with Muhammad, who has a knack for dodging secret service agents — so she can bless them with her custom-made hats.

    She’s made fewer than 400 over the years, she told me. Each recipient is gifted the hat and her cheer, and it’s hard to tell what is more appreciated.

    In fact, someone else can tell the story better, so [click here and read it](http://members.jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-08-13/story/jacksonville-woman-has-made-custom-caps-350-celebrities-including-5). You can’t help but smile.

    I marvel at the nimbleness of Muhammad’s mind and her refusal to live in rigid categories. She’s a converted Muslim who sides with Tea Party politics, but voted for President Obama. How’s that for nimble?

    But more than anything I marvel that she took the time to honor me with TWO of her hats.

    I am a part of a club that includes the likes of Jamie Foxx and Dr. Phil, other “best heads” who have been pictured with Muhammad.

    “I’m on top of the world.  It’s too crowded on the bottom,” she e-mailed to me, her infectious cheer in every sentence. “Our motto says ‘[the best heads on the planet’ wear our CAPS.  I have read a few of your articles, and I would say , you fit that profile  You will be the only kid on your block with a (Bilal) custom CAP.”

    I swear to God I felt like I just won an Oscar! I read the email to my mother, like bringing home an A on a paper (which didn’t happen all that often for me, I have to admit).

    She sized my custom made caps from a photo of my head (which I still can’t figure out. Amazing!) And then shipped them out to me. Her emails continue to brighten my day.

    “This is  going to be FUN,” she wrote me. “I am so excited.  Imagine that… being on the internet where thousands of folk can see what you are doing. O N L Y I N A M E R I C A. Excuse me if I sound silly…”

    Only in America, indeed, can a screw-up recovering alcoholic like me who pounds on a keyboard each day to make a living while trying to make a positive difference, be honored by a woman across the country who happened to notice what I write.

    Several times since my hats arrived I put one on as I worked just to feel more upbeat about my day. If there is just one thing missing from this blessed exchange its the photo that Muhammad always gets when she gives a hat. She’s got a massive wall of photos in the tailoring shop she and her husband operate filled with famous people and her. So I can’t fly to Florida, but I think I need to be on the wall…

    I doubt Mr. Foxx will mind if I use his body. I hope not anyway. Someday, I’ll meet this wonderful person in person, but until now this will have to do, simply because looking at it makes me smile.

    Like I said, she’s an epidemic of cheer, which Lord only knows we need far more of these days.

  title: A mother’s day reunion long overdue
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Mother’s day means different things to different people.
    But few can relate to the Mother’s Day Criminal U’s own Tony Yarbough experienced
    this year.\n\nTony has been planning this bittersweet reunion with his mother
    and sister since he first went to prison more than two decades ago — wrongfully
    accused as their murderer — when he was just 18 years old. This Mother’s Day,
    after being exonerated and freed, he was able to visit their grave site in prison.\n\nTony
    shared a gut-wrenching day with close friends.  I spoke with his step-mother,
    who has been there for Tony since he was released, on Mother’s Day. She said Tony
    was concerned about the lack of a proper gravesite for his mother.\n\n“We need
    to do something about that,” the told me. I agreed, though we weren’t sure what
    exactly, right now.\n\nGod took care of that for us all. An anonymous donor came
    forward after reading the story and offered to buy a headstone for his family.
    \ Tony also received a badly needed VISA card from a Criminal U supporter the
    next day.\n\n“I am amazed by how things aligned,” he told me this morning. “God
    is validating everything.”\n\nPart of that is Tony’s future. He is determined
    to be a voice for change. He is bringing his passion and speaking abilities and
    personal experience to Criminal U’s platform to work for change. In an announcement
    coming later this week, Tony will take on a new role with Criminal U, that will
    make our collective effort so much stronger.\n\n[The story](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-wrongfully-convicted-mom-sister-murder-seeks-peace-article-1.1788533#ixzz31cGBRsYQ),
    by New York Daily News Columnist Denis Hamill is worth reading. Hamill played
    a key role in helping bring long overdue justice to Tony.\n\n> He looked like
    a lost little boy searching for his mother.\n> \n> Even at 275 pounds and standing
    at a towering 6-foot-4, Tony Yarbough appeared childlike as he carried two bouquets
    of roses on Mother’s Day through the verdant, eternal pasture of Rosemount Memorial
    Park, a cemetery in Elizabeth, N.J.\n> \n> He’d traveled here with friends and
    his attorney Phil Smallman from St. Albans, Queens. As songbirds chased each other
    through the budding oaks and jets roared into the blue heavens from nearby Newark
    Airport around 8:45 a.m., Yarbough searched for the side-by-side graves of his
    murdered mother, Annie Yarbough, and little sister, Chavonn Barnes. The girl and
    mom were two victims of a horrific triple murder in Brooklyn for which Tony Yarbough
    served a wrongful sentence of 21 years and eight months in prison.\n> \n> Yarbough
    was freed in February when Smallman and another lawyer presented compelling new
    proof of coerced confessions and DNA evidence that propelled the newly elected
    Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson to ask the court to vacate Yarbough’s
    conviction and free this innocent gentle giant of a man.\n\nIt wasn’t easy this
    mother’s day, but it was blessed, as Tony now can pay his proper respects, allow
    himself to grieve, and yet still enjoy the love of his step-mother who has stepped
    in to provide that important care.\n\nGod is, indeed, paying attention, as things
    start to align for Tony.\n\nNew York readers: We need to find this man a job.
    He’s working hard toward his education. He is training for his eventual work as
    a positive activist and leader. If we can find him a job that will be the bridge
    between here and there, things really will align.\n\nThanks!"

  title: 'Rule #2: Love fully but slowly'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Speaking of love…If I am convinced of one thing it is that love can no more be controlled than the oceans can be silenced. Like waves that rip out and gather themselves and crash with energy back from which they just departed, love is part of the life force, movement and sustainability of Earth. It is sort of like nuclear energy – full of limitless power that makes it so very dangerous if not handled with care – but even more so. It is awesome and horrible, beautiful and treacherous, peace and terror combined. Love is our Fountain of Youth, our Mount of Transfiguration, a never-ending green flash, our Garden of Eden. It is the greatest of all renewable resources.

    To fear love — and thus to step outside of it so as not to be overwhelmed by its power — is to remove yourself from the life cycle. At that moment death begins its work on you. Your pulse may take years to finally extinguish, but you are already a daily special for worms somewhere up ahead. To avoid love is to try to avoid the Sun.

    So we fear love’s heat but crave its warmth and back in our God-mode (see rule 1), we seek a more controllable middle ground. Never is human folly as evident as when we opt for a middle ground when it comes to love. We convince ourselves love is a wild horse that simply must be broken, trained and corralled. Then it can be ridden, with us pulling the reins, perched atop of it without acknowledging how we have diminished it so.

    Though such notions are comforting they remain folly. Love is no more likely to be harnessed and led by a bit in its mouth then God is willing to be nothing more than a genie in a bottle.  In my experience many of the same people who cook up such silly notions of God are the same ones who love as if they alone bear the rider’s crop. This is control, not love. Two more foreign concepts don’t exist. Oil and water mix more successfully, than love and control. God let us in on a little secret when so often He said He and love are one. Consider John 13:35: Jesus said that people would best know him by how his followers loved each other.

    Think about that. Do you wonder like I do if Jesus wished he could take back that one
    Somehow despite knowing what colossal screw-ups we are with love, God baked it into the bread anyway. Love is not part of the equation of life; love is the calculator. Love is not an ingredient; love is the bowl in which all of the other ingredients are mixed.

    If you are going to truly live, you must wrestle with love despite knowing you stand the same chance of victory as Jacob did when he had the balls to grapple with God.

    Sometimes you just do what you have to do knowing full well you’ll limp the rest of your life because of it.

    So, love fully.

    Anything less is a flimsy substitute, a zircon, a reduced-fat fraud. Love is the uncut diamond of purest quality. Don’t settle for less. Don’t offer less.

    But….

    Ah, But. There’s always a but, right?

    I didn’t just attempt to explain energy so powerful that words do it an injustice because it was only a wonderful thing. You can’t dismiss love’s terrifying power. You can’t for a minute doubt it could consume you like the mortician’s oven. So the greatest caution must be used to love those worthy of you, to love those capable of loving you in return. Love fully yes, hell yes, but love slowly.

    Approximations of love have their rightful place in this world. Romance is a delightful one. First kisses are all that, which is why so many storytellers focus on the first kiss rather than the ten-year anniversary. We call that falling in love because, again, we want love on a level where it’s manageable. But it is just romance, a nice, even exhilarating yet tiny subset of love. Because romance is so tame, you’d do well to enjoy it. It is a Labradoodle puppy compared to the roar of the lion of love. I wish you several first kisses and all the deliriously joyful butterflies in the stomach that come with it. Just enjoy with restraint on your heart. Don’t force love into places it is not properly prepared to bloom.

    Sex is a subset of love, but not entirely. Some sex is nothing like love and is something sinister and odorous. At other times sex is a part of romance and provides comfort and pleasure. At times it is the antidote to an anxious heart or a struggling mind. Few things restore like the willing embrace of someone who cares.

    But it is more than that too. I wouldn’t want anyone to live a life with all its trials and suffering and not experience the holy and miraculous transcendence in those rare times when sex flows from the source of genuine, unconditional and committed love. This is the stuff that creates music for lyrics and turns prose into poetry. This is the surfer on the crest of the monster wave.

    If you love slowly, you are most apt to ride the dragon of love and not be scorched by the fire that flows from its nostrils. If you love slowly, you are most likely to have something of your own that is genuine and pure to offer as well.

    Before we leave the notion of love and sex let me be clear that more often than not the two are confused rather than harmonically combined. They are often discordant notes, minor keys full of woe, choked in our collective neurosis, selfish needs and addictive motives. Though I can’t describe well when sex and love combine with the flow of the creative force of the world, I just know they do. And when they do for you, you’ll know. The sound is perfect pitch, four-part harmony, the music of angels.

    This is the point where our society often jumps into the psychological quicksand of being a “good lover.” Of course, I have my own thoughts on that. I have spent a lot of time mulling, reading, pursuing the techniques of a confident lover, and I’d be remiss in not sharing that insight gained here, even when so many of the lessons come from such ridiculous failures that I still feel my face flush with embarrassment at the memory. But I do not wish in any way that sex, a small part of the awesome entity of love, cloud this rule. I’ll reserve further discussion down the road a bit when it is given a more humble, suitable place of importance. The music of angels is not one that keeps score from a judges’ table of how well you performed your moves. Trust me on that one.

    Love fully… but slowly, and may you ride the monster waves now and again. ***** Your task in life is to love fully, albeit slowly. And that includes a great many relationships other than whoever will become your one true love.

    In your life you will love friends, family, siblings and your parents, besides just your lovers, if you are to truly experience life as it is intended to be. All of these relationships require just as much tenacity as your one true love. All these perch you, like it or not, just as firmly in the crest of the wave and upon the back of the dragon — even more so if only because they are longer lasting relationships with roots back to your first fully human thoughts. Here you already know how painful love can be. You can already point to the scars and limps you’ve acquired from wrestling with the pure power of love. Yet the great challenge is to embrace this love, to accept it for all its accompanying difficulties and to fully surrender. You can no more amputate this love than you can chop off your head.

    So stop and re-read all of what I’ve said about love, with these relationships in mind, as opposed to just sex and romance and love. It looks a bit different, right? Just let that settle for a minute.

    Oh shit, right?

    Exhausting, I’m sure. Can’t we just settle for holidays and occasional emails instead of genuine love of our family? Hmmm. To do so is to be diminished, to try to tame the horse. Ride the dragon. Feel the heat. Accept the burns. Because families are the people who can best love us despite all our flaws.

    The whole rule still applies, even with family. Love fully, but slowly, even within this small circle of “family,” even as you form those few close friendships you hope will last a lifetime. This affords you some breathing room. You still must respect the power of love. Love slowly. Jesus said don’t cast your pearls before swine.

    Learn to see the heart, not the words, not even temporary actions, of those you wish to love. When you see the heart of love, slowly reveal your own. The power to see beyond the failings of the moment or the peculiarities of the individual is the power to know someone heart to heart. To love fully. To move beyond the emotion of the moment.

    At this point, slowly, you’ll begin to know and love those few people you are called to really love. God calls this unconditional love. It is a blessed thing to give and receive. Rare. A gem. It is not for the faint of heart. But it is very worth it.

  contentAboveNewsletter: "Perhaps the biggest lie within the criminal justice system
    is that once you’ve done your time, you’ve paid your debt to society. This topic
    could lead to a lengthy (like book length) exploration of how the concept of parole
    — which earned an inmate the right to supervised early release — has turned into
    “post-prison supervision,” which dramatically extends the time of “paying your
    debt to society.”\n\nI’ve written and said often a truth I had to come to grips
    with myself: *When you leave prison you haven’t paid your debt to society. You’ve
    simply paid the exorbitant interest on a credit card that is nearly impossible
    to pay off.*\n\nWorse, the simple word “felon,” more than anything else, ensures
    that any conviction is a life sentence.\n\nHere’s one felon’s perspective:\n\n>
    Whether you’re trying to get a job or rent an apartment, you know the application
    will ask The Question: “Have you ever been convicted of a felony?”\n> \n> For
    most people it’s an automatic “no.” But for millions The Question is an automatic
    disqualifier – a reminder that even though they’ve paid their debt to society
    they’re still shadowed by the stigma of a felony conviction.\n> \n> I’m one of
    them.\n> \n> More than 20 years ago – after growing up in San Francisco, going
    to Catholic schools, and playing music in the city’s nightclubs – I was convicted
    of drug possession for a third time. That earned me a sentence of three to five
    years in state prison.\n> \n> I was lucky. The judge offered me  rehab rather
    than prison. I knew I needed treatment. I entered a residential drug program and
    emerged 18 months later, clean and sober.\n> \n> It turned my life around. I earned
    my master’s degree in English, published stories and books. But because of my
    record, I’m barred from what I really want to do – teach high-school English.\n>
    \n> I’ve stopped applying for jobs in the private sector, where my answer to The
    Question sends my application to the trash. I’ve been turned down twice for places
    to live. My wife and I weren’t allowed to adopt children.\n> \n> My felony conviction
    is a life sentence. But the stigma is starting to fade.\n> \n> Last year California
    prohibited state and local governments from asking about conviction history in
    the first stage of job applications. Recently San Francisco limited the power
    of most private companies, as well as landlords for affordable housing, from asking
    about criminal records. They also must consider how long ago an offense occurred
    and whether it’s relevant to the application.\n> \n> Punishing prisoners after
    they’ve done their time is unfair. It makes finding a job or an apartment harder
    and is one reason why recidivism is up 500 percent in California since my convictions
    and the prison population is so high a federal judge has ruled it cruel and unusual
    punishment.\n> \n> Listen, if I can turn my life around, anyone can. Our jails
    and prisons are filled with untapped potential, people who could help lift our
    country up. We just need a fair chance.\n> \n> With a Perspective, I’m Richard
    Martin.\n> \n> Richard Martin is development director for a nonprofit that helps
    incarcerated people and their families. He lives in San Francisco.\n\nvia [Life

  title: N.Y. father’s conviction, coerced confession tossed
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Another New York black man who gave a coerced confession looks well on his way to freedom, according to his attorney, following a decision to toss out his confession.

    He may face a new trial, but with a case wholly built on that confession, it is far more likely he will soon be free. For now, he remains behind the barbed wire and bars of Criminal U, getting an education he may have never deserved.

    Click [here](http://www.news10.com/story/24777675/new-trial-ordered-for-adrian-thomas-murder-case) to watch this two-minute newscast. You see Adrian Thomas toss a folder hard to the ground and you think, “the bastard did it.” A jury thought that too. What they didn’t know was how coerced that action was and how coached it was and how desperate it was.

    Sound familiar? A white cop, coerces a confession from a distraught black man, the only “suspect” ever considered for the death of family member.

    Criminal Injustice blogger [Hannah Riley](http://hannahcriley.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/a-turning-tide-in-new-york-state/comment-page-1/#comment-83) was one of the few out there who wrote about this case. She details the tactics used by the New York police. Any parent in that state of mind — a child dead, but being told he is still alive — can imagine the mental distress Adrian Thomas was under when he confessed.

    Save your son’s life… confess!

    Your wife is going to jail… confess!

    It’s an accident… confess!

    You can go home… confess!

    Here’s the talley: “Throughout the course of the interrogation, they told Thomas 67 times that they were sure it was an accident, 14 times that he would not be arrested, and eight times that he would be going home if he simply confessed. At one point in the interrogation, a detective told him, ‘*You want to save your son’s life, man?  Why are you holding out on me?*’” Riley wrote.

    Of course we’d all like to think we know better. We’d never admit to doing something we didn’t do, we reason. If they guy confessed, he must have done it. Case closed.

    This is exactly why police tactics so often will go to any length to get a confession, when case after case shows that they are virtually meaningless.

    Until the general public begins to grasp the desperate reality people face when their world is crumbling around them, they simply won’t understand the steps necessary to give all people their basic right of innocence until proven guilty in a court of law, free from the coercive tactics of police interrogations, prosecutors threatening extended sentences and many other pressures the criminal justice brings to bear on anyone they believe is guilty.

    Here’s the most troubling part of this case: This didn’t happen in the 1980s and the 1990s in places like Brooklyn where so-called “rogue” cops used unjust tactics to lock up the likes of Tony Yarbough and David Ranta. This happened in 2008 in a suburb of Albany that is home to fewer than 50,000 people. These aren’t “rogue cop” tactics. These are tactics, period. Its the playbook, far more often than we think, where police start an investigation with someone “they like” for it and simply build the case, often with a coercive confession pried out through deceitful, even illegal practices.

    Why? Because more often that not it works. And until this is changed, we will read more and more stories about a father of six spending five years and counting behind bars for a murder he very likely did not commit.

  title: Where did media go now that young Gallo is locked up?
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Siblings quarrel. It’s baked into the bread of what it
    means to be a sibling. But a quarrel between 17-year-old Travis Gallo and his
    older sister exploded into a fatal stabbing that has forever impacted the lives
    of a large suburban New Jersey family.\n\nAccording to a NewsOne report, Travis
    Gallo killed his sister, twenty-year-old Teia Gallo, in December with multiple
    stab wounds. Both siblings, along with Teia’s natural sister, were adopted by
    Hackensack gynecologist Robert Gallo and his wife when they were young. The couple,
    who are white, has twelve children all together. All three adopted children were
    black.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crime, news stories focused on the family, with
    neighbors in the affluent Washington Township neighborhood, calling them “close-knit.”\n\nThe
    weight of the unsaid in these articles — the fact a white doctor with nine biological
    kids adopted three black kids — burdened the reports but was never fully addressed.
    Until it hit social media that is, where the topic burst open.\n\n“Seems to me
    the good doctor ignored all the warning signs as to the nature of his Negro son,”
    Blogger Ozzie Saffa wrote. “At the end of the day it boils down to nature vs.
    nurture. Nurture lost this round.”\n\nDr. Gallo said he had no idea how the violence
    broke out.\n\n“She was a loving kid. She was adored by my grandchildren, by her
    sisters and brothers,” Dr. Gallo told NorthJersey.com. “My family is devastated….
    We’re a very strong family. There’s a lot of love and a lot of hugging, and we
    will get through this. We will weather this storm.”\n\nBut close friends of the
    victim said Teia had grown wary of a growing anger in Travis. Teia’s friend, Jennifer
    O’Connor said the Dominican College student was preparing to move out to get away
    from her adopted brother.\n\n“It was getting bad,” O’Connor said. “She wanted
    to live on campus next year to get away from his anger.”\n\nThe violence, the
    inter-racial family situation and the charges Travis, a minor, will eventually
    face filled newscasts in the aftermath. Dr. Gallo said his adopted children had
    blended well into his family and the largely white community they lived in. He
    said he was aware of tension between the two siblings but that it was nothing
    out of the ordinary.\n\nDr. Gallo said he grieved for both his children.\n\n“Two
    lives were lost,” Dr. Gallo said.\n\nBut are they? This is the most telling question
    going forward and one the media lost all interest in. The murders happened shortly
    after Christmas. Travis Gallo was behind bars before New Year’s Eve. Not another
    national story has been written. \n\nWhy not? As a former editor I can’t imagine
    letting this story go, especially not the local newspaper, The Record.\n\nIf Travis
    is charged as an adult he will face a minimum sentence of thirty years. If he
    is charged as a minor, he will face a twenty-year sentence. A Bergen County prosecutor
    said she will decide if Travis is tried as an adult in thirty days, which expired
    several weeks ago. More than likely he has been charged. If I had to guess, he
    has been charged as an adult. But the sad part is, I have to guess. Short of contacting
    the prosecutor myself, no report seems to have been posted.\n\nWhat is the state
    of the family now? Has Dr. Gallo provided for his son’s defense? Has Travis been
    visited by any of his siblings who are so numerous they can field their own softball
    team? Again, I don’t know.\n\nIf the family reacted by disowning their murderous
    brother/son, that’s their choice. Nobody could blame them. The grief, shock and
    confusion has to be insurmountable at times. But what if they didn’t? What if
    they sought to offer him support despite his actions? What if the “close-knit”
    family chose to fight to resolve this terrible crime of passion?\n\nAre two lives
    lost? It doesn’t have to be that way. Sure, Travis Gallo could be tried as an
    adult and locked up for life. The Gallo finally can write him off and move on
    to rebuild the peace in their lives they once cherished. Nobody would blame anyone.\n\nBut,
    what if justice and mercy were considered. What if Travis is tried for what he
    is, a boy. Does anyone ever stop and consider that the fastest way to become an
    adult in our society is to murder someone? What type of rite-of-passage is this?
    Do we truly believe that children are not adults until 18 as the law states and
    that as children the law affords them certain protections that it doesn’t afford
    adults? If so, then shouldn’t this boy be tried as a the minor he is?\n\nConsider
    this for a moment, the difference between a life sentence and 20 years in prison.
    Twenty years is no picnic, just ask Tony Yarbough who was released last week for
    a murder he did not commit. It will be a brutal time in which Travis Gallo will
    have to decide for himself what type of person he will re-introduce to the world
    once he’s free. But he will have a chance to be free. He will have hope.\n\nDo
    two lives have to be lost in this case? And does anyone really care? I ask again,
    where is the media now that the blood has been cleaned up and the “breaking news”
    has broke? The real stories are just beginning for everyone involved except the
    poor victim, Teia Gallo whose life can never be brought back."

  title: It’s hard not to like grown-up Michael Vick
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I root for Michael Vick and that makes me very unpopular in some crowds. I follow Michael Vick on Twitter and that makes some folks scratch their heads. I’m a fan, which is saying something because I’m not a guy who is a fan of most people.

    I used to work in the newspaper business, which meant I met a lot of people who fascinate others. I met actors and athletes and lots and lots of politicians. I learned a couple of things: 1) they are rarely the brand they promote and 2) they are human.

    A friend of mine who came from Hollywood where he knew everyone who is everyone said most people are “starfuckers.” They get googly-eyed about their favorite stars, and those in those rarified circles know it.  It’s this star worship that fuels the paparazzi and Us Weekly and makes a shot of make-up-less Jennifer Aniston pumping gas worth a bunch of cash. These stars say they hate it but many will use and abuse these fans and inflate their sense of self. My friend liked me because he said I wasn’t a starfucker and he found that refreshing.  I didn’t really know one way or another because it was a job and I didn’t really think about it much.

    My point though is this: to admit I’m a fan of Michael Vick is saying something.

    Now, I’ve never met Vick. I’m not sure I want to because I don’t want my enthrall with him to be diminished. I’m content with Michael Vick the brand just in case Michael Vick the man pales by comparison.

    So why am I a fan? Because Michael Vick grew up. I read a story the other day about how Vick is now a backup, nearly “[a forgotten man](http://www.csnphilly.com/football-philadelphia-eagles/now-backup-michael-vick-thinking-team-first)” on the Eagles. I read he says he is content. I  read the article and I saw a guy who changed, which to me is about the biggest compliment I can give. I could care less about perfection. Life is hard. It’s how we change and grow that matters.

    Vick had it all and lost it. That doesn’t make him unusual. Most reports at that time showed an arrogant, defiant man who felt he was above the law headed to prison feeling very much like the victim. That not only didn’t make him unusual, it made him common. I’ve been there. I know how hard it can be to break through and see things differently, especially when you need to figure it out while pushing a mop along a prison block floor. Few do it, and that’s what makes him unusual.

    Michael Vick not only did it, he recovered his life. He kept his family. He remade his millions and from the news stories that I read, he figured it out. When the [Riley Cooper racist scandal](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/31/riley-cooper-racist-n-word-video_n_3684651.html) threatened to tear apart the Eagles season before it started, Vick was out front offering leadership and grace to a fellow screw-up.

    Now, even on the bench, he’s still a respected leader. He’s the biggest cheerleader to the man who replaced him. I don’t think you can fake this stuff. I think sooner or later in the hot glare of stardom your true colors will shine through. So far anyway, Michael Vick’s true colors look like that of a grown up.

    In prison guys would often say defiantly, “I’m a grown man,” because the whole system treats you like a child. But few acted like grown men. Prison is one of the most childish places I’ve ever been. It makes a frat house look mature. I learned if you had to say it, it wasn’t happening. I have never heard Vick tout how changed he is. I’ve never heard him boast he’s a grown up. But I see his actions from afar and I see a grown man.

    That’s why I’m a fan.

  title: Furniture companies wary of Unicor competition
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The Great Recession wasn’t easy for those who supply office work stations, chairs and other furniture. For industry leader Herman Miller competition seemed to pop up like relentless Whack-a-moles in arcade.

    But ironically, as overseas advantages lessen due to rising costs like fuel and wages, and as manufacturing returns to the United States, another threat to Herman Miller rises from one of its own customers, the federal government.

    Unicor is the fancy name of a federally owned manufacturing company — in existence since the 1930s under the name Federal Prison Industries — that uses inmate labor throughout the Department of Corrections to make things, such as jeans, electronics and yes, office furniture.

    Unicor operates numerous factories using inmate labor that often pays less than a dollar an hour. It is a serious player in this competitive marketplace, holding 14.5% of the market for cabinets, lockers and shelving and 9.3% of the office furniture market.

    Herman Miller has lobbied Congress about Unicor’s [unfair labor practice](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2004/02/26/when-your-competition-is-in-prison.aspx?source=isesitlnk0000001&mrr=1.00) for years, which may have had something to do with Federal government contract GS-28F-8049H, awarded to Herman Miller in 2010, giving the company a slice of the government’s business.

    It’s the way Congress works with major companies to keep them from raising too much of a ruckus, while undercutting them with prison labor, one of the government’s “best kept secrets.” Congress may not know how to pass any meaningful legislation for the two million dependent on unemployment benefits or the 11 million undocumented workers or even the millions hoping for a new jobs bill, but it sure can get out of the way of federal contracts designed to keep major businesses on the payroll and quiet, if not happy.

    Laws that limit the company’s ability to directly compete with companies like Herman Miller because of its unfair labor do not succeed in an outright prohibition. As a result, Unicor, is expanding to the commercial sector.

    Unicor even has gone so far as to list its office furniture products on its [website](http://www.unicor.gov/) for purchase. Anyone can browse the site and order just as they would from say, Office Depot, or Herman Miller.

    Government documents that talk about the recent push to “repatriate” jobs from overseas back to the United States are used as source material by Unicor for its plans to expand and increase profits. How many voters thought bringing jobs back to the U.S. meant jobs for inmates making literal change per hour.

    Apologists will say these jobs are good for the inmates. They learn a skill of manufacturing furniture and get paid. True on both accounts. Except that inmates are most often required to work at rates beneath human dignity, to say nothing of hoping to save for rebuilding their life upon release. If this was such a good deal for inmates, why are so many forced to do it?

    Others say, surely the profits must go to improving inmate rehabilitation programs or living conditions, which any inmate can attest is not happening. Programs are cut, facilities are old, and in some cases even condemned, but still are stuffed beyond occupancy limits with new inmates.

    When people talk about the industrialized prison economy, this is what they mean. It’s a complex, government-controlled, public-private partnership on a vast number of levels with hundreds of different vendors profiting for the business of incarceration, largely funded by the American taxpayer. Those undercut the most are American workers whose jobs, wages and benefits are constantly under threat.

    Still think the epidemic of incarceration that costs between $50 billion and $74 billion  a year nationally doesn’t affect you?

  title: Criminal justice reform gets plenty of talk, little action
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    In case prosecutors, parole officers, judges and corrections staff didn’t get the memo, tough on crime is no longer in fashion.

    Even die-hard conservative Rick Perry said so during the 2014 CPAC convention when he touted closing down a prison in Texas.

    “We aren’t tough on crime, we are smart on crime,” he boasted.

    Nobody seemed to quibble that the number of beds they saved in closing the prison was roughly proportionate to the number of people the state has exectued in the past five years, but we’ll save that little discussion for another day.

    The fact is The Tipping Point of criminal justice reform has arrived. Lengthy sentences for drug charges are being reduced. Pre-trial diversion efforts are growing. Renewed interest in proven programs that reduce recidivism has taken root all across the country. Media outlets like the recently launched Marshall Project are dedicated solely to this issue. Politicians from both parties have suddenly [discovered the political will](http://nationswell.com/criminal-justice-reform-democrat-republican-support/) to bring lasting change, as Nationswell pointed out recently.

    But if you closely follow many of the state and local criminal justice organizations, the same tactics that led to this country’s epidemic of mass incarceration remain commonplace. The country’s thought leaders and those tasked with the daily machinery of the gears of this industrialized prison economy are oceans apart.

    In [a compelling interview by The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/01/12/sure-people-are-talking-about-prison-reform-but-they-aren-t-actually-doing-anything), longtime activist and journalist Paul Wright articulates this disconnect.

    “Sure, people are talking, but they aren’t actually doing anything, ” he says. “The Obama administration has pledged to be more open and transparent, and yet, as someone who runs an organization that has Freedom of Information litigation pending against the Department of Justice, I can tell you that nothing has changed under this administration.

    ‘You and I can talk about space exploration and stuff, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to build a rocket to go to Mars.”

    Wright would know. After spending nearly two decades in prison, he started [Prison Legal News](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/), which became one of the most significant voices of education and advocacy of the past twenty years.  The website may not be the biggest, but few inmates haven’t had the basic black and white newsletter passed to them from cell to cell. It’s widely distributed throughout prisons and remains one of the important ways inmates can get accurate information and prison-related news.

    His words chill those of us who see the lack of change and its impact on people still caught up as grist for the mill. At Criminal U we’ve spent 15 months now engaging people and trying to find genuine solutions. It’s been a lot of talk and very little call to action. The easiest way for those inside the system to say no, is to simply delay and talk and obfuscate an idea into oblivion.

    For the past 25 years Wright has followed the issues of incarceration and criminal justice. He’s seen the rampant build up and experienced the general indifference that has allowed it to happen. So his warning that all the talk about reform, at least so far, has amounted to little more than political posturing demands attention. This issue is too important for political posturing and endless talk.

    Until collectively people care, turn that care into a demand for solutions and stay engaged enough to expect accountability and results, the Tipping Point of reform will far more about cheerleading and conversation than actual human transformation and rehabilitation.

    Finally, to the one point often made to encourage a status quo that based far more on ignorance and indifference than intelligence, consider Wright’s simple argument.

    __The Marshall Project__: Well, some people’s response to that would be, "Then don’t commit crime. Prison isn’t supposed to be fun."
    Wright: Yeah, and it wasn’t fun, so I guess they get their wish.

    The thing is, a lot of people commit crimes, and they don’t go to prison, and it has less to do with what you do than your financial status and your class status in society. After I had been in prison for a while, I realized I hadn’t met any rich people. And it’s not that rich people don’t kill or rape people, they just, as a general rule, don’t go to prison for it. If we had a system of justice where everyone who commits a crime is punished equally, I’d be fine with that. But that’s not the case.

    It’s not. It’s unjust. And until it is reformed, the justice system in this country will continue to be anything but.

  title: Society unprepared for return of juveniles tried as adults
  author: Halim Flowers
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I have been incarcerated for 17 years. Coming to prison as a juvenile sentenced as an adult was a trying experience for me as a minor around prisoners that had been imprisoned longer than I had been alive. The incarceration of violent juvenile offenders has increased rapidly since the ’90s, a point in the penal system where “warehousing” inmates instead of “rehabilitation” became a policy of state and federal corrections. I know what its like for many of us juveniles tried as adults.

    A lot of attention has been recently put into the “[school-to-prison pipeline](https://www.aclu.org/school-prison-pipeline).” Also, the U.S. Supreme Court has issued rulings in *Roper v. Simmons, Graham v. Florida*, and *Miller v. Alabama* that detail critical neuroscience information previously ignored in sentencing of juveniles. This science explains the lack of development of juveniles brains and the ability that this has on minors participating in reckless behaviors without having the foresight to weight the full consequences for their decisions.

    But no one is highlighting the effects of juveniles spending decades in prison. Now that the SCOTUS has ruled that most juveniles cannot be sentenced to life without parole, what steps is the prison system taking to prepare these citizens to successfully transition into society after being incarcerated for 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 yeas in prison from the age of 14, 15, and 16?

    In my post on this blog, I will share my personal experiences as a 16 year old doing time in various state and federal prisons and the effects that it has had upon me. All of my experiences has been [documented in my books](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=halim+flowers+in+books&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Ahalim+flowers+in+books) or watching my documentary titled [“Thug Life In DC.”](https://youtu.be/NVRO2qmiXKo)

    I can honestly say that 95 percent of juveniles serving long sentences are not prepared for society and that releasing them back to the community unprepared is a public safety factor.

  title: Cell phones in prisons? thank the guards
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    During an National Public Radio interview on a variety of prison topics with Laura Sullivan, NPR’s prisons and police correspondent spoke about the rising problems of cell phones inside Criminal U.

    SULLIVAN: Absolutely. I mean, cell phones have become a huge problem in the nation’s prisons. Wardens across this country will tell you that they – it’s a problem they simply don’t know how to get a hold of. And it’s also a problem that a lot of prison officials don’t want to talk about because the truth is that most of the cell phones are getting into the prisons through correctional officers.

    CONAN: And that’s presumably a lucrative business.

    SULLIVAN: Absolutely. I mean, right now, the going rate, prisoners tell me, is about $500 for a cell phone. So – and once it’s out of the officer’s hands, there’s no way to really trace it back to that officer. It’s just $500 easy money.

    And then on the outside, the families will pay the service plan. Families will give it to the correctional officer, who will just be a pass-through to the inmate.

    via [Inmates’ Jobs, From Call Centers To Paint Mixing : NPR](http://www.npr.org/2010/12/16/132112124/inmates-jobs-from-call-centers-to-paint-mixing).

    The guards — officially called correctional officers by their politically correct title — understand life inside better than most people on the outside. Many are simply hostile. They’ve been around enough inmates to know the revolving door that brings them back again and again. They’ve seen the cons and the games and all the stuff that makes working with inmate population so difficult. They know well that every stereotype is true to some degree.

    But they also, more than anyone, capitalize on the system and contribute to its brokenness. It’s the dirty secret of the Department of Corrections, only its not a secret and few administrators have the will to change the culture of exploitation that exists among prison guards.

    They bring in cell phones at $500 a pop. When the pressure gets high, they’ll lead the search that discovers those cell phones and send the inmates with them to the hole. They’ll smuggle in cigarettes and drugs and what not, then turn around and bust inmates for contraband. They’ll make sure their dealer gets by without being searched.

    Of course, I’m stereotyping. The response: A few bad apples. Of course. But we don’t know, because there are no statistics. Nobody really wants to know how bad the problem is because they know: it’s bad.

    Prison reform has to include those who run the prisons. It needs a complete culture change, one that values those trying to be part of the solution rather than those who simply want to profit from the situation as it is. Nobody knows this better than prison administrations. But when will they get the will to enact true change?

  title: Inside Innovations joins wave of innovation for inmate education
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    It started as most innovative solutions do, in one of those late night conversations between friends trying to solve the world’s problems. We didn’t know it, but Inside Innovations was born.

    My close friend and colleague [Mike Green](https://twitter.com/@amikegreen2) and I were discussing our common interests in helping the disenfranchised reconnect to the opportunities that are abundant now as the country’s innovation economy boosts it from the morass of The Great Recession. [Mike’s work](http://blackinnovation.org/) focuses on urban blind spots that have not been empowered to compete. My work focuses on inmates who cost society so much, having been one myself, and cost people plenty.

    Together we dreamed up an opportunity. It quickly emerged as something that needed to be far more than talk. Neither of us had the time. Neither of us could see how to navigate the massive hurdles and opposition.

    Thank God we didn’t let that stop us. Now, we are pleased to announce Inside Innovations, a pilot program that offers a 12-week crash course to soon-to-be-released inmates in the cutting edge lessons from the innovation economy.

    We take it further than just classes though. We offer the latest  and best thinking on developing emotional intelligence, a key ingredient that is often overlooked but is vital to ongoing success. The great guys at [Mindful360.com](http://www.mindful360.com/) jumped in to show us a way to incorporate this needed instruction.

    Then we took it to a whole new level, envisioning the first-ever [Hackathon](http://oaklandlocal.com/tags/hackathon/) inside the barbed wires and bars of Criminal U.

    We talked with some former professional athletes who are now competing in the innovation economy and asked them to lend their voice. A coalition of common ground emerged between us and many vital leaders in diverse fields.

    And we found an enthusiastic supporter in Oregon, First Lady Cylvia Hayes, who invited us to speak to her legacy initiative the [Oregon Prosperity Initiative](http://www.oregonprospers.org/).

    We knew we could no longer ignore the signs. We made time for to create Inside Innovations.

    Now we need your help. You can do two POWERFUL things to help this movement grow and it won’t take more than five minutes of your time.

    1) Tweet this story to your networks and tell everyone you know you believe in this.

    2) Click to our [fundraising campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/inside-innovations-turning-inmates-into-entrepreneurs/x/8034798) and buy a cup of opportunity for inmates who will soon be returning to a community near you. For five bucks (or more… we love more!) you can cast a powerful vote for reform. Bypass one trip into Starbucks and give that instead of the future of your community by helping turn inmates into entrepreneurs.

    Do both now and join the movement!

  title: 'Rule #21 – Be there'
  author: Andres Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    If one aspect of my heritage stands out above all others it is in the value of family. (Food is a very close second, with wine and God somewhere in the mix). It transcends everything else. Professional success is great but not at the expense of family. Family always even with all the headaches that comes with it… especially with all the headaches that come with it.

    Family goes beyond relationships. It is a broad concept in the Italian culture. It encapsulates God (our Father), and faith, food (the thing that brings us together), love, and one more biggie I see lost too often in our American culture: priority.

    Visiting is an event in our culture. The rest of life stops. We visit, an active verb that is layered with meaning. Food emerges. Wine breathes. Laughter echoes. History is passed along.

    Nothing ever takes the place of simply being together. Being there. Nothing says I love you like showing up. When it’s hard, good, great, sad, boring, fun, whatever, we have a task: Be there.

    My grandmother was 95. Still, many of the younger relatives, many in their 70s themselves –and in worse shape than Nonie I might add– would make it a point to come to visit. They knew the one coin of the realm with Nonie was being there.

    Shortly before Nonie died, my family arrived back at her house from several days boating. We were dirty and tired. We needed to store some stuff and get on our way back to the city and to our lives.

    When we arrived Nonie was visiting with old friends. We went in and did the introductions. We apologized for our appearance. We made None’ happy by paying our respects then we cleared out. All except for my paisano, a fellow Italian who was my friend since high school. He was the best man at my wedding. He needed a shower, he said. We all rolled our eyes. Damn pretty boy! We unpacked while Paulie disappeared into None’s house.

    When the time came that all work was done, we tried to leave. Only Paul hadn’t returned yet. I envisioned him still primping in the bathroom.

    “I’ll get him,” my son said, eyes rolling.

    “Nah, I’ll get him,” I said. “I gotta say bye to None’ anyways.”

    Paulie sat at the head of the table, laughing and eating cake, surrounded by senior citizens, all enthralled by his arrival.

    “Scotty,” he said happily. “You gotta try this cake!”

    That’s family. That’s what I mean when I say you need to “Be there.”

    Make Sundays about the biggest bowl of pasta and our family’s sauce. Make time for big meals. Make it a priority.

    When life kicks the wind out of someone in your family’s gut, you feel it too. Their gasp for air is yours. Their priority is yours too. That’s family.

    If America has a fatal flaw (besides [a food culture that kills us](https://www.amazon.com/Prison-Spreads-101-culture-recipes-ebook/dp/B00GS7QH06/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1388773371&sr=8-11&keywords=bolsinger) while claiming only burger and fries and polyunsaturated fats as our own) it is the loss of this priority, and even more so the loss of loyalty.

    Instead, we’ve lost the value of being there. We’ve lost the priority of family, of someone other than ourselves. We look out for number 1. Live the dream. Climb the ladder. Win the election.

    At all costs.

    Our loyalties shift with the wind. We build alliances not families.

    Ask yourself two questions. Who will you stick with? Who will stick with you? When everything has crumbled, when you’ve made the worst mistake of your life…again…who?

    For me its family. They were there for me. They didn’t run when all the trappings of my life’s “success” were stripped away with salacious headlines of my scandalous fall. They bailed me out. They wrote letters. They stood fast. They waited for the better me to emerge, confident he would. And they celebrated with me when they were proven right. In hell or on the other side, they were there.

    What’s first for you? How do you define it? How do you live it so that nobody doubts its priority?

    The only way to show it is to be there. To celebrate. To mourn. To play. To argue. To love. And especially to visit. There is no substitute for being there.

    you remember, and of course, never forget.\n\nSept. 11, 2001 began as it always
    did in the newsroom. Reporters sleepily wandered in around 8 a.m., punched on
    their computer screens, checked emails and decided on a story or two they could
    pitch. The city editor would normally call the reporters over at 8:30 for the
    morning budget meeting. A “budget” in a newsroom is a list of coming stories.
    Every reporter better have something to add to it. Each day we’d stand in a circle,
    one by one “pitching” stories for the upcoming edition, while the city editor
    grilled us about the story’s merit or lack thereof. Our boss thought it was an
    edgy corporate leadership style to make us all stand rather than sit at the conference
    table behind us. We hated it. The city editor struggled to take notes standing
    up, while reporters squirmed like elementary students.\n\nOn Sept. 11 The Boss
    arrived at 8:15. Always neatly attired, suit and tie cover his cartoonishly thin
    body, with his 1950s-style hair cut slicked to one side with a perfect part, he
    walked through the newsroom offering his usual greetings.\n\n“Morning. Morning.
    Good Morning,” he’d say to each person he walked past before disappearing into
    his office. It was his ritual, another trick from some corporate manual to show
    he was a man of the people or some such thing. He’d do it religiously each morning
    and evening when he arrived or departed. The Boss had an arsenal of these tidbits
    he’d employ regularly, like the whole mandatory tie thing that every reporter
    despised. I once showed up dressed stylishly in a sports coat and a dress-knit,
    round-collar black shirt on. No tie. He beckoned me to his office within the hour.\n\n“At
    the Daily News-Record,” he said plainly, a wry smile across his lips, “men wear
    ties.”\n\nI started to argue.\n\n“I look professi..” I started to say.\n\n“Ah
    ah aha…” he said, holding a finger up. “At the *Daily News-Record*, men wear ties.”\n\nPressing
    my point I pointed an accusatory finger at a Fred Flintstone clone who sat at
    his cluttered desk just outside the office. A glob of shaving cream was still
    perched in his ear and a 1970s wide plaid tie, wrapped in a strangle knot at his
    neck with the uneven strands hanging in disarray over his pronounced belly.\n\n“So
    that’s acceptable but this,” I waved my hands in front of camel hair coat and
    black shirt, “ is not because I don’t have a tie?”\n\nHe smiled.\n\n“At the *Daily-News*…”\n\nI
    threw my hands up and left his office to go fetch a tie, hearing his chuckle in
    the background. From there on out I wore ties, just like the one I wore on Sept.
    11 as I sat filling in at the vacant city editor desk at the front of a the newsroom,
    rifling through emails as The Boss made his introductions and walked through the
    newsroom shooting off his “Mornings” as he walked by.\n\nA short while later,
    I noticed we were late for the budget meeting. I poked my head in The Boss’ office.\n\n“Should
    I gather the troops?” I asked.\n\n“Oh yes,” he said looking up from his emails
    and checking his gold watch — the kind you still had to wind — that his father
    had given him. “It’s that time. Let’s do it.”\n\nWe gathered round and the budget
    meeting began. As one of our best reporters pitched a story about fungus in the
    national parks, our features editor walked around the huddle of reporters and
    switched on the TV behind us.\n\n“Sorry to bother you, but it looks like a plane
    hit one of the World Trade Center towers,” the editor said.\n\nThe meeting paused
    as we all turned to watch the news. Speculation and journalistic curiosity stopped
    the budget meeting cold. We all turned to the TV.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes,
    The Boss reluctantly reformed our circle. Despite the obvious breaking national
    story, we needed to get to work on our local stories. We knew nobody would care
    about fungus or school boards with a tower in New York on fire, but that’s why
    they call it the Daily Beast. It requires feeding, no matter what. A fire in New
    York would fill a news hole, but not the main pages in Virginia. With our collective
    attention divided between the task at hand and the news report on the TV, the
    meeting dragged on past 9 a.m. My attention had shifted entirely to the TV. I
    watched, not even sure what I was seeing, as a second plane hit the second tower.
    At that moment, all discussion about local coverage ended.\n\nThe publisher, –
    son of famed Virginia legislator Sen. Harry Byrd – our general manager and The
    Boss gathered in the conference room to plan our coverage. The involvement of
    the owner at this level hadn’t occurred in decades. While the bosses met, I decided
    to plan ahead. I assigned each reporter a local angle on the tragedy, formed teams
    of reporters and photographers to work together and called my sources in Washington,
    D.C. for updates. Members of the night crew started to arrive hours before they
    were scheduled and we discussed tentative assignments, awaiting The Boss’ final
    approval.\n\nI called a woman I had dated briefly who worked on the Mark Warner
    campaign for governor. I had spent a lot of time on the campaign trail with Warner
    the past 18 months. I had also hung out with his staff after campaign events talking
    politics over drinks, decidedly off-the-record. I knew she’d tell me what was
    going on. She answered, her normally practiced political spin voice completely
    erased by obvious terror.\n\n“We don’t know what’s going on Scot,” she said. I
    heard the tremor in her voice. “We aren’t sure whether to leave or stay.”\n\nSuddenly
    I could hear a blast sound over the phone. She screamed into the receiver.\n\n“Are
    you OK?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm over the clamor of the newsroom.\n\n“What
    was that?” she yelled to others in the room.\n\nI listened to make sense of the
    noise. I scribbled notes on a Steno pad of everything I heard in the background.
    The Warner Campaign headquarters were within a stone’s throw from the Pentagon.
    After about thirty seconds of chaos, she realized she still held a phone in her
    hand.\n\n“I’m sorry Scot, I’ve never been so scared,” she said.\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“They
    don’t know. They think it was the sonic boom of military planes taking off. I
    better go…”\n\nI made her promise to call me later and assure me she was safe.
    I also wanted information I could attribute to sources close to the Pentagon,
    literally in this case. Even at a time like this, even when someone I considered
    a friend was in danger, the breaking news story remained foremost in my mind.
    It was hard-wired into me by this point.\n\nBy 10:30 a.m., with news of another
    plane down in Pennsylvania and another crash at the Pentagon, the bosses decided
    to publish our first afternoon special edition since the attack on Pearl Harbor
    sixty years prior. The Boss returned to the newsroom with the approval for the
    special edition. I handed him my budget for our comprehensive coverage.\n\nHe
    read it quickly and said, “Okay, let’s go.”\n\nThe reporters collectively hit
    the phones and streets in organized teams.\n\n“Three hours,” I reminded them.
    “Make sure you keep in touch with me.”\n\nThe entire organization had its finest
    moment in those next few hours. Everyone pitched in. Soon we started trying to
    guess the casualties. We learned more than 50,000 people worked in those Twin
    Towers. We discussed applicable comparisons. One editor suggested we compare it
    to the entire number of casualties lost in the Vietnam War. We pushed the human
    appalling helplessness and sadness to the back so we could just focus on the job.\n\nThe
    first newspapers hit the street on time at 3 p.m. as cars lined up out front of
    the building. Receptionists sold copies outside the building like hawkers from
    the 1920s. Upstairs in the newsroom we didn’t have time to stop. The entire process
    had to be updated and repeated by the 11 p.m. deadline for our normal morning
    edition. The Boss was still reading stories at home even as the final pages were
    sent to print, for the second time that day. He may have been a pain in the ass,
    but he was a journalist who knew his shit. On that day, we all rose to the top
    of our game. Everyone knew that this was the reason we did the jobs we did: Breaking
    news. It made the low pay, long hours and reporting boring stories in bumfuck
    Egypt worth it.\n\nSomewhere amid all my responsibilities, I wrote our front-page
    analysis:\n\n__Title: Tragedy Without A Name\nDate: September 12, 2001\nBy: Andrew
    Scot Bolsinger__\n\n> Soon, a name will be given to a single day so shocking,
    that for now at least, it defies naming.\n> \n> World Trade Center Attack? No,
    that was just the opening chapter. Airline Terrorism? Does nothing to describe
    the heart-wrenching deaths of New York firefighters coming to the rescue of others.\n>
    \n> Throughout the day, news anchors compared Tuesday’s horror — played out live
    before a nation’s astonished eyes — to Pearl Harbor as perhaps the greatest attack
    on American soil.\n> \n> The very scope of it all — four hijacked commercial airplanes
    crashing throughout the East Coast, dive-bombing the Pentagon, destroying both
    towers of the World Trade Center, crashing in the country’s heartland — defies
    a name.\n> \n> Evil does that. It transcends our capacity to imagine, much less
    name.\n> \n> Fifty years from now we will remember where we were and what we saw
    when this disaster took place. By then, whatever name sticks to label this American
    nightmare will be remote history to the next generation.\n> \n> It will be in
    history books. Other generations won’t grasp the terror, because by then, evil
    will probably find even more horrible ways to display itself.\n> \n> But I doubt
    we will forget.\n> \n> We won’t forget the images on the television screens, or
    the sad wish that this were just another made-for-television movie.\n> \n> We
    won’t forget the surreal images of towering infernos with no sign of the absolute
    horror taking place inside and on the streets below.\n> \n> We won’t forget the
    empty feeling in our stomachs, as we struggled to comprehend the staggering reality
    of the thousands of lives struck down.\n> \n> The evil of this day has seared
    a nation’s soul. But history also teaches us that it will not crush our resolve.
    For a day, one tragic, horrible day, America was brought to a standstill.\n> \n>
    In the days to come, Americans everywhere will unite with a resolve to thwart
    this evil and others in the world like it.\n> \n> This event will soon be named.
    When it is, let’s hope it stands for the country at its best in times of tragedy.\n\nWe
    wrapped around 12:30 a.m. only to return en masse by 8 a.m. the next day. Not
    a single person complained about long hours or even questioned it. Nobody had
    to ask anyone to come in early and stay late. We again published two special editions,
    working long past midnight. The Features Editor designed beautiful news pages.
    Reporters covered different beats. The work just got done. On the third day we
    went back to one edition, but included an eight-page special section on follow-up
    coverage of the events of 9/11, the tragedy that now had a name."

  title: 'Rule #5: Be kind'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Years ago when I taught high school I led a tour of a dozen or so students to Washington, DC. I recall much of that trip fondly. The schedule was jammed with museums, historical places and memorable sights. Yet one stands out, distinctly because it was not enjoyable.

    We spent a couple of hours touring the Holocaust Memorial, wandering from exhibit to exhibit, through the vast museum, all of which powerfully conveyed the tragedy of genocide. Few exhibits grabbed the students by the collar and seized their attention like this tour did. It whispered in every ear, “Attention must be paid.” Tears trickled down cheeks. Sweat formed on clammy palms. Our spirits merged and mourned for a people we did not know in an era far removed from ours.

    We gathered at the end for a moment of silent
    reflection, just our group. I felt the need to say something, yet wondered if this was one of those times to stay out of the way and let each person take a few steps of their own on their spiritual journey. Finally I took out a big white card and a sharpie and wrote “Be Kind.” I held it up and said, “If you folks learn anything that lasts on this trip, please learn these two words.”

    I’m still working on learning that every day. I hardly knew what I spoke of at the time, but I felt it.

    As time passed I realized that little seed had started to grow. The idea of being kind soon infused much of my response to the world around me. I remained a highly flawed person, full of struggles and failings. But I’ve never forgotten that when in doubt simply try to be kind. I think it became a fundamental aspect of how I saw myself and a standard I could gauge my actions.

    If it were easy to be kind, the world would be a gentler place. Kindness remains rare, an endangered species of human behaviors despite [bumper stickers](http://www.randomactsofkindness.org/) that state “Practice random acts of kindness.” Easier said than done, though well worth the effort.

    I don’t think it’s a coincidence that eventually I found my soul mate in a woman who was, and still is, the kindest person I know. I’m enthralled by her kindness. It’s a perfect rose in the midst of thorns, weeds and crabgrass so common in our world. The more I’m touched by her kindness, the more I’m determined to find reserves of it within myself.

    I truly believe kindness kills cancer and other illnesses. Kindness flows out of us releasing a healing energy within us. It is as important to my day as physical exercise, good, healthy food, vitamins and things that strength and challenge my mind.

    In my journey through the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, I learned how resentments formed within us like emotional cancers. They fester and latch on and spread through our souls. Yet the only cure is not what I expected. I assumed I’d eventually have me to go to the people that hurt me and the people I resent and tell them how their actions affected me. Instead it was the opposite. The steps directed me to make amends to those I hurt. In the steps I had to be kind. And because the process of making amends will likely take me a decade or more, I’m constantly having to search my actions for the things I do to hurt others and find a way to respond in kindness. The discipline of kindness results.

    As for those who hurt me, I learned two powerful things. First, often they are the same people I hurt. By making amends I often found remission of the cancerous resentments inside of me. I never saw it coming. I assumed it would work like a children’s sitcom. I’d say sorry, the other person would say sorry, we’d hug and it would all be better. But it didn’t work that way at all.

    In one particular instance I spent a long difficult time listening to how I caused pain. I wanted to fight back and defend myself. I felt my own hurt rise up anew. Instead I prayed. Then I apologized and I changed how I acted in ways the person said they wanted.

    And that was it. The other person never heard me out. They never apologized. But they felt better. They forgave me. Within a short while, I realized my resentments were gone as well. I just felt the kindness I lacked suddenly emerge. For a long time now it seems to have stuck around. The cancer is gone, kindness in its place. Those unexpressed grievances aren’t that important to me any longer.

    The second powerful thing I learned is called the resentment prayer. Alcoholics Anonymous instructs people struggling with resentment, to channel their energy differently. Instead of letting those negative thoughts run on an endless loop in our mind, poisoning our mood and fostering bitterness in our soul, they instruct us to pray for these very people. And the prayer isn’t “Lord, smite these sinners!” No, it’s the opposite. The resentment prayer is a prayer of blessing, more along the lines of, “Lord, you know So and So and how I hope they burn in hell, right? Well, change of plans. I’d like you to bless them. I’d like you to make their lives wonderful and beautiful and free them from all that ails them…”

    I admit I prayed these prayers through gritted teeth. But I prayed the prayers. In the days that followed, I felt the grip of resentments lessen. Soon, I rarely thought about these things at all. Eventually, I experienced forgiveness to some degree.

    Jesus instructed us to love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. I never fully understood why we had to do this until I actually did it.

    I learned one other amazing spiritual truth about kindness the deeper I delved into it and sought it for myself. It is one of the spiritual gifts of the Holy Spirit. “Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control. Against such things there is no law,” The Apostle Paul — himself once a very angry hateful dude — wrote to us. Kindness isn’t something only a few wonderful people are born with. It is a gift from God that we all can have if we take the time to ask for it.

    The more we receive, the more we give it away and the cycle continues to gain steam producing positive energy that truly can transform a human heart, a relationship, a community and a world.

    In every circumstance, in every relationship, in every day opportunities to respond to our environment will present itself. In each one, as much as possible, give serious consideration to a kind response. At times the kindest thing will cut like a scalpel. At other times it will comfort like a mother’s embrace. In all circumstances, it will infuse you with a sense of empowerment.

    Remember, be kind.

  title: 'Talent pool: Prison reform from the inside out'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Entrepreneurism 101: Recruit talent. A deep talent pool is the key to the inevitable challenges that will come. Talented people will figure out the skills. You can teach skills, but talent is harder to find.

    Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg drove this point home during a recent conference when he said, “I will only hire someone to work directly for me if I would work for that person.”

    Zuckerberg seeks talent. Obviously it works for him.

    So I can’t help but wonder, why do we waste the vast talent pool when it comes to prison reform?

    Sit back and think for a moment if could gather the incredible talent pool that has either graduated Criminal U or remains enrolled.
    - We could have political leaders like Rod Blajovich, Ray Nagin and Jesse Jackson Jr.
    - We could have Former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik and any number of corrupt cops who have both put people in prison and gone themselves.
    - We could have pro athletes like Michael Vick and Plaxico Burress.
    - We could have business giants known and unknown like Bernie Madoff, Jeffery Skilling and Bob Boyd.
    - We could authors known and unknown like Piper Kerman and Halim Flowers.
    - We could have activists and thought-leaders like Paul Wright and Toni Bunton.
    - We could have stars like Don Cheadle, T.I. and Chris Brown.
    - We could get entrepreneurs like Glenn Martin and Frederick Hutson.

    In short, we’d have a vast cross-section of those who shape and influence public opinion, those with access to billions of dollars, those with the proven skills to completely revamp the broken, industrialized, billion-dollar boondoggle that is the American criminal justice system today. Each and every one of those in the room would have first-hand, personal knowledge of life inside the bars and barbed wire of America’s prisons. Each and every one would know the humiliation, dehumanization and destructiveness of the prison cycle. Each and every one would have skin in the game.

    The old ways, old methods, old plans haven’t worked. We know that. The cobbled, shot-gun approach to reform currently underway is creating a push for soundbyte over substance, funding over freedom and isolation over cooperation. The vast scope of prison reform can’t be effective if it becomes a patchwork quilt of self-interest. Instead we need a focused 21st century, innovative, cooperative game plan that evolves our systems and overcomes our flawed thinking that resists such change.

    Prisons teach people how to do more crime. Our War on Drugs and Three Strikes and myriad “tough on crime” laws tried to remove millions of people from society, but 95 percent of those locked up are coming back someday. The cost to society in both incarcerating and releasing millions of inmates with the Scarlet Letter of Felon around their neck creates a permanent underclass and an equivalent life sentence.

    In this day and age where abundant innovation, income and entrepreneurial vision abounds, why haven’t we tried just once to apply such new thinking to an archaic prison system? With such a deep talent pool of Criminal U graduates, why haven’t we held a reunion–complete with Skype access to those who remain inside and want to start giving back now–to dream up a whole new plan for justice that balances incarceration, correction, rehabilitation and re-entry?

    We’d like to host a Criminal U Reunion Conference. We need all these people involved. We need one key sponsor to help us make it happen.

    With all that talent in once place focused on one issue, a genuine outcome with measurable plans for reform is all but guaranteed.

    Just imagine that talent pool in that room. Just imagine what we could do.

  title: Thank you John Legend, I guess
  author: R.L. Pelshaw
  contentAboveNewsletter: |
    I sincerely appreciate John Legend’s efforts to [help end mass incarceration](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/13/john-legend-mass-incarceration_n_7053996.html?ir=Politics&ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000013) through his just announced Free America campaign.  I love John Legend. I believe he means well,  and that his heart is in the right place. Sadly,  his efforts will not make the change he seeks.

    Countless billions of dollars have been spent on enforcement, imprisonment, and reentry with no real progress. We all know something needs to be done, but the smarter sentencing John Legend advocates falls pathetically short of addressing the fundamental reason why so many citizens land in, and return to, crime and prison. I support smarter sentencing and anything to help decriminalize our society. The answer to mass incarceration is not just lowering the bar; the answer is in addressing the reasons why people commit crime to begin with.

    Recent studies report there are around 26 million felons alive today. It is demoralizing that even though ex-felons out of prison seven years or longer have no higher crime rate than the rest of society, most felons cannot get decent jobs. Mr. Legend reinforced that fact by saying “once you have that tag of a felony on your name, it’s hard for you to do anything.”

    Many people engage in crime to support themselves when they can’t find a job at a livable wage. Employers not hiring people with criminal records inadvertently force them back to crime to survive. Among those ex-offenders that re-offend, 89 percent are unemployed when they are re-arrested.

    That leads to this question, and solution: Could employers not hiring felons be contributing to higher crime and recidivism rates?

    We can rescue people from crime forever, and improve our society, if employers would consider hiring ex-felons. I am not anti-employer, I’m pro-employer since employers are more a part of the solution than the problem. Employers need to know there are substantial bottom-line benefits, resources, and protections that are easily available when they hire someone with a criminal background.

    Many employers complain about the lack of a good workers. Hiring qualified ex-felons expands their hiring pool.  Turnover is a huge problem for many businesses, but felons given jobs likely stay longer due to a lack of employers hiring them. In addition to substantial tax credits, free fidelity bonding is available to employers that hire ex-felons. Most employers are ignorant of the fact that they might be violating employment laws by discriminating against ex-felons.

    Crime and recidivism costs everyone. John Legend, employers, and you can be a part of this common-sense solution by helping to spread the word about the National Hire Ex-Felons Campaign (HXF). Please help us launch our Crowdfunding program on RocketHub.

    MR. LEGEND: Instead of another “cause du jour,” concert, or just lowering the bar on sentencing, please commit to helping us address a major cause of incarceration and recidivism. Please use your considerable influence and compassionate heart to help spread the word about the Hire Ex-Felons Campaign, and to let people know about resources available to help ex-felons who cannot find a job start their own business.

    HXF is a grass-roots campaign designed to:
    1. Create a national conversation to raise awareness that ex-felons who cannot find a job might return to crime to support themselves.
    2. Educate ex-felons and employers, through conversations and the Ten Bottom-Line Reasons to Hire Ex- Felons brochure, about the free protections, resources, and benefits of hiring ex-felons.
    3. Encourage employers to hire ex-felons, either for the bottom-line benefits and/or to help impat crime, recidivism, and our society.
    4. Encourage the free use of the HXF Campaign Logo to build awareness and brand recognition, and to reduce the negative connotations of the words “felon” and words similar to it.
    5. Build and maintain a list of felon-friendly employers to recognize and reward them with praise and preference in patronizing their businesses.
    6. Help make ex-felons better job applicants and employees through additional free resources we will provide and promote.
    7. Inform people that if they still cannot find a job they should use the book Illegal To Legal: Business Success For (Ex) Criminals to help them start their own business. This book shows offenders, ex-offenders, and those at risk to offend, how to use their life skills to start a business and become an employer hiring ex-felons themselves. Starting a business is far better than returning to crime or going back to prison. Hopefully, their new ventures will also hire ex-felons.

  title: 'Rule #15: Share sex, don’t take it'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Prison is, by definition, degrading. It starts with intake where you wait for hours and hours in a cement room on steel benches to be called out for increasingly degrading acts leading right up to the strip search.

    Much of it is intentional, like when guards call you “inmate” as a title.

    But of all the degrading, dehumanizing things an inmate endures, the worst may well be done unintentionally among inmates themselves. The coarse, over-compensating talk of sexual adventure that fills endless hours of boredom sears the mind. It dulls our humanity in ways that is hard to imagine.

    For inmates who spend so much of their adult life locked  up, their is never a shortage of talk about sex. It is almost universally boastful, detailed objectification of the physical act. It can curdle your ears if you let it.

    I resisted this act of dehumanization and objectification as I did many other things that I knew could harden and change me forever. I had to make the decision early, when during a lunch conversation of the coarsest kind an inmate asked me about my “old lady.”

    “She is my wife,” I said. “And she is none of your business.”

    Had I farted it would have been less awkward. The inmate felt disrespected, even though his five-minute graphic retelling of a drug-induced sex act disrespected himself and his (imaginary?) partner more than I could ever do.  I knew the risks when I stood my ground.

    Some things were worth fighting for.

    The shared experience of sexual intercourse, when done properly, is one of life’s great events. Poor or rich, beautiful and ugly, smart and dumb, man and woman alike can freely participate in it. No membership card is required.

    Yet sex remains a source of so much pain, which is why I offer this rule, boiled down to a brass tacks starting point on a quite expansive topic, Rule #15: share sex, don’t take it.

    I’m no expert, not by a long shot. The nuances of sex is a topic worth reading about. When in a trusting relationship it should be an area of communication rather than mystery. Sex, like wine, is best savored and shared, not glugged. Though I only speak from my limited experience, I believe a true sign of adulthood is when one recognizes the importance of maturity when it comes to sex. Perhaps these few thoughts can assist the maturation? Lord only knows how abundant models of selfish immaturity and tragic violence we are inundated with in our culture.

    “Don’t treat your wife like a whore,” a spiritual mentor advised me when I was a 20-year-old father, virtually ignorant of the challenges of a loving relationship. He couldn’t be more right. As I’ve pondered this among many hours contemplating sex, I’ve tried to take it to heart. I think back over the times a woman has invited me or accepted my invitation to make love and one pervading thought transcends all others: “The generosity of women never ceases to amaze me.”

    I’m still pleasantly surprised women find men attractive and actually welcome us into their bodies. Seriously, if I think about it I just have to smile.

    So I’ve come to believe an attitude of gratefulness is not a bad approach to the act of sex. It takes our focus off ourselves and off our own inadequacies. Trust me; everyone feels that inadequacy, which is precisely why our culture is filled with such fantastic attempts at overcompensation. Dr. Freud knew well of what he spoke. For example, virtually every guy in prison claims to have a 10-inch dick despite all evidence to the contrary on display in a shower with 50 other guys. Now that’s denial. When you can’t have sex you better create some stories to tell, I guess.

    Set yourself free from treating sex like a taboo. Seek advice when needed, especially from your lover. Accept and defend the delicate balance between healthy talk and necessary privacy. And especially don’t brag. We all know you’re lying, just as she is when she tells you she can’t imagine Don Juan being a better lover.

    Use your whole body in lovemaking, not just the most obvious part. Pleasure flows from so many places, sensations and experiences beyond the nuts and bolts of the missionary position. Use the right tool for the job, as handymen like to say. Don’t use a hammer when a delicate touch is necessary, but don’t try to drive a 16-penny nail with a feather. There’s time for touching and time for…well the obvious stuff.

    Spare yourself, and your lover, from your ego. She won’t see fireworks every time and few things are more annoying than our clumsy attempts to light up the sky when the clouds have rolled in and the rain is falling. But, still, when the time and mood is right be patient and attentive enough to give her the Fourth of July. She deserves it, remember, she’s invited you in after all.

    Yes, snuggle. It really is important much of the time. Remember how you act immediately after making love will likely have a lot to do with how soon you’ll be enjoying it again.

    Hitch was right by the way: “You come 90 percent, let her come the last 10 percent. Never take the whole 100!”

    Be spontaneous.

    Remember No is No. Simple as that.

    And please, take it from me and remember that no one under the age of 18 can legally consent. No is always no, yes is no, and you better know better.

    Avoid these ruts in the road. If you are almost always taking your own clothes off instead of hers, you’ve probably hit a rut. If you’ve had sex more than you’ve kissed, you moved into a rut deeper than you can imagine. The same is true for holding hands.

    Fast, slow, tender, rough (slightly), simple, extravagant, quickly, slowly. Each has its place and time. Learn to anticipate which is most appropriate and you’re well on your way to being a competent lover.

    Taking, demanding or manipulating another person to get laid is simply abhorrent, despite how easy it is to seduce yourself into believing it’s OK. And no, everybody else is not doing these things. Power really has no place in sex that is meant to be shared, not controlled. We’ve all lost sight of this… well, I have anyway, I won’t speak for others. The times I lose sight of these basic notions of respect and dignity and mutuality directly correspond with some of the worst relational failures and abuses of my life.

    I’d wish everyone a good sex life, it’s that wonderful. But understanding and defining “good,” is the great challenge. Most answers offered are woefully wrong.

    When in doubt, ask, be it advice or permission.

    You don’t need sex, as much as you think you do. That’s no excuse for bad behavior. Still, there’s nothing wrong with wanting sex…really, really badly, especially if it makes you a more attentive partner. And remember the golden rule. Follow it and you’ll be OK.

  title: My, how things change
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    In 2012 a New York Times columnist wrote that the political will for reform didn’t exist. Now politicians elbow each other in line trying “lead” they way toward a reformed criminal justice system.

    Just like that unseen forces have set up a quilting station and all sorts of strange bedfellows–conservatives and liberals and libertarians, rock stars, actors and athletes, entrepreneurs, convicts and activists–have grabbed a needle to stitch in their prison reform patch.

    This race to prison reform will likely cost us this opportunity, this moment in history, where a new system of justice and rehabilitation can emerge. Cosmetic changes and minor reductions in sentences make voters feel better while allowing the great industrialized prison economy to hum along unimpeded. The machine will be leaner and meaner, but the system itself will remain.

    Which means *those who profited the most from the mass incarceration of American citizens will continue to profit even as the effort of reform is underway*.

    The prison system is an industry–a multi-billion dollar industry–that corporations, politicians, the American Bar Association, police departments and business executives have profited from for decades. Wall Street loves the prison industry for its recession-proof profits and political support. So you’d think all this prison reform talk would have the investors jumping into lifeboats without regard for women and children first.

    Think again.

    Corrections Corporation of America is a bellwether stock. It’s the largest incarcerator of Americans outside of the federal government itself (it boasts of this on reports to stockholders while ignoring mounting civil suits because of shoddy care and inhumane treatment of inmates). It’s been a lock profit for more than a decade. Follow its trend and you can see where the industry as a whole is headed.

    Common sense tells us that with all the talk of sentence reduction and re-entry programs designed to reduce recidivism would be bad business for a company that makes its profits locking people up. Common sense doesn’t apply. It’s been [a banner year for investors in CCA](http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=CXW).

    Just look at the snapshot of the stock during the past year of a rising chorus for prison reform.  This graph shows its five-year gains. But the last year, 2014, when prison reform became the cover photo of the political Vogue, the prices rebounded to five-year highs.

    Business is good in the prison industry.

    In late 2013, I wrote a handful of articles for The Motley Fool about the industry of prison. I chronicled the stock positions of companies like CCA and prison food vendor Aramark. In reasoned tones I advised investors about the strengths of these stocks. My editor loved my stories and approved every one I pitched until one day, for reasons never explained, several editors all read my stories. I could see them on the content platform. And just like that I was sent a letter saying my writing wasn’t good enough and my services were no longer needed. No reason given, I just didn’t cut the mustard. But then about a week later, each story I wrote for The Motley Fool [disappeared](http://caps.fool.com/search/solr.aspx?q=Bolsinger&dataSource=article&dataSource=blog&dataSource=blog-comment&dataSource=board&dataSource=comment&dataSource=pitch&handleSearch=true). Don’t believe me? [Click here](http://caps.fool.com/search/solr.aspx?q=Bolsinger&dataSource=article&dataSource=blog&dataSource=blog-comment&dataSource=board&dataSource=comment&dataSource=pitch&handleSearch=true). See the headlines of the stories I wrote. Then click on them. What do you see? Page not found.

    So much for the ethics of online print, that can simply be erased when the powers that be demand it, a perfect example of the failure of two American institutions I once called home: newsrooms and prisons (and don’t say Motley Fool is the only company that erases online stories. Newspapers I once worked for, so-called papers of record, also redacted stories under pressure. Think about that for a moment: if everything ends up online, than anyone powerful enough can re-write history and newspapers have already proven too weak to resist).

    Someone didn’t want stories about these stocks, stories that explained just why they were so profitable. Someone made them go away.

    That is the power of the industrialized prison system. That is the system reformers are up against. They are the judge and jury. They allow the innovative programs and reform efforts to feed a small bit off the billion-dollar beast, so they can continue to eat the heart of it unhindered.

    Yes, more people are getting a patch on the quilt. Yes, interesting reform ideas and/or activist organizations are seeing more money for their effort. But it’s like a tithe from Jimmy Swaggart back in the good old days of Televangelism. Send a fat check to some Third World orphanage and buy yourself a gold-rimmed Bentley back home.

    The fat cats stay fat, while tossing kibble to the hungry masses of prison reformers, who don’t complain because they now get to eat a little too.

    You can’t reform a broken billion-dollar boondoggle with the same structure in place. You can’t reform injustice until the injustice is exposed. You can’t fix a thing until you understand how its broken.

    The very best thing that could happen with prison reform is if all current effort simply stopped. In quiet of inaction we’d have to take a hard look at the industrialized machine that whirrs along without a care in the world by all the current clatter for prison reform.

  title: Former Columbian cartel ‘prince’ fights to regain freedom
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  isFirstStoryOnFrontPage: true
  isTopStory: true
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Andolian Juan Ochoa-Napraja Jr., a former drug cartel family
    member, has no shortage of names, including Lewis James Martin, Yosanti Juan Blanco
    and the Infamous Paper Boy.\n\nHe also has no shortage of experiences to draw
    from as he works to build a new career as a writer.  He says he founded the multi-million
    dollar drug organizations Junior Cartel and El Santas Muerte Cartel when he was
    still a teenager.\n\nHe says all of that contributed to his reputation as a “notorious
    Columbian cartel prince,” who helped build a multi-million dollar drug ring. “My
    parents raised me to be ruthless, ambitious and calculating in the drug business
    from a very young age,” he says. He draws heavily from his life in his first book,
    [Columbian Blood](https://www.amazon.com/Colombian-Blood-Novel-Andolian-Napraja/dp/1517239354),
    which he self-published recently.\n\nAndolian wants to walk a fine line, using
    the stories from his criminal past to fuel his ambitions to rebuild a successful,
    legal life in the future.\n\n“This life has cost me everything,” he told Criminal
    U. “One must survive. I will survive.”\n\nAndolian says his parents were critical
    figures in three of the biggest drug cartels in the world: Bogata’s Cartel Del
    Norte, Medellian’s Pablo Escobar cartel and Griselda Blanco’s Miami organization.\n\n“These
    are three of the richest and more powerful cartel’s in history,” he says.\nHis
    mother, Rosalyn “Columbian Roz” Martin-Blanco gave birth to Andolian when she
    was just 13 years old. His father, Felix Ochoa, was based in Bogata. \n\nAndolian
    says the cartel earned $12.5 billion a year selling cocaine.\n\nWanting to earn
    favor with his parents and extended family, Andolian launched his Junior Cartel
    in 1995 and recruited hundreds of young black men. His father helped him build
    distribution points  in places like Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Detriot, Texas
    and Miami. He launched another, with older more experienced Columbians working
    the trade.\n\nOnly 5′ 6″ tall and 150 pounds, Andolian said he commanded respect
    despite his size because of the strength and rapid growth of his own empire, which
    he says brought in more than $1 million a day in sales.\n\n“I lived a lavish life,
    like a true prince,” he says, “with world-class homes, sports cars, luxury planes
    and yachts. I was obsessed with it all.”\n\nIt didn’t last long. In 2000, Andolian,
    aka Lewis Martin of Detroit, was charged with a laundry list of serious charges,
    eventually leading to convictions for trafficking, conspiracy to distribute money
    laundering, RICO violations, armed robbery of an armored car, tax evasion and
    weapons charges. Barely an adult he faced live in federal prison until he won
    an appeal. He served nearly 15 years before his release in March 2015.\n\n“I taught
    myself to write in prison,” he says. “I wrote my life story Junior Cartel: Rise
    of the Infamous Paper Boy, which hasn’t been published yet. I wanted to publish
    Columbian Blood first.”\n\nHe was determined to live a different life once outside,
    even though it has not been easy. He was sent back to jail for a parole violation.
    Before he can rebuild his new name and new life, he must serve a few more months
    as inmate #373542 at Handlon Correctional Facility in Michigan.\n\nThe many names
    were part of the problem he faced on re-entry. He had no legal ID in either his
    real name or his assumed named, Lewis Martin, as the state knows him. He couldn’t
    get an ID, which kept him from getting a job or earning a living or even opening
    a bank account.  Without proper ID, he couldn’t get assistance. His many requests
    to solve the problem were greeted with indifference from his parole supervisors.\n\n“It
    seems the only thing they want me to do is go back into the cartel business with
    my family,” he says. “I made a lot of mistakes in my life and now I’m trying to
    clean them up. But the systems acts like they do want me to. The government doesn’t
    want me to succeed as a tax-paying citizen. They want me to be a drug lord.”\n\nWhich
    he refuses to be, he says. Instead, he writes all about it.\nHe admits he still
    has strong feelings for those he once considered family, his brothers-in-arms
    who at a very young age felt like they ruled the world.\n\n“We have always said,
    ‘brothers in life, brothers in death,'” he says. “We had over five hundred main
    members of the Junior Cartel and 40 main members of the El Santas Muerte Cartel.
    They all know what those words mean, our bonds last forever in life and in spirit.”\n\nHe
    knows people are fascinated by the life he led, so while some may accuse him of
    glorifying it, he believes he’s using it for the right reasons. Writing is an
    outlet for his frustrations, but also a step toward a life beyond his past. He
    prepares for his next release, knowing many of the same challenges remain.\n\n“If
    I am still unable to get legal documents and get on with my life, then I am lost.
    Hopefully, it will be easier this time around, but who knows. All I can do is
    wait and see what happens,” he says.\n\nAnd keep putting pen to paper, letting
    the stories from his “infamous” past spill out, a glance to the past with an eye
    toward the future."

  title: Grand juries can indict a ham sandwich but not a cop
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Anyone who has been anywhere near the criminal justice system in this country has heard the cliche: You can “indict a ham sandwich” if  you are so inclined. The movie The Bonfire of the Vanities helped make this a cliche. It’s deeply rooted in fact.

    The point: Grand juries largely follow the lead of the only “experts” in the room: The prosecution. Defense attorneys are not allowed. The prosecutor rules the day and typically gets his or her wish, which is most often to bring charges.

    It’s part of the mission of grand juries. They are convened, not to try cases, but to simply express enough merit to proceed. In theory they protect the accused from frivolous charges or over-zealous prosecutors, which is badly needed in this day and age where a charge will forever alter your life, be it innocent or guilty, and where once in the system extreme sentences can be piled up in a threat to force most people into taking a lesser deal. The words “grand jury” are the bulls-eye of the need for reform, and nothing has better evidenced this than the recent grand jury ruling to not indict Officer Darren Wilson in the Ferguson, Mo. shooting death of an unarmed teenager named Michael Brown.

    Consider it again: Grand juries almost always follow the lead of the only expert in the room. In this case, they followed suit. They did what they could be expected to do, the bidding of the prosecutor. The prosecutor, who could easily indict a ham sandwich, did not want to indict a police officer. He succeeded.

    Much has been made of the case and its merits, but again the system fails us. The merits of the case won’t be known, because the only place to really get to that is in a court room filled with experts, where defense lawyers and prosecutors and judges are in the room with juries, where an established set of rules guide our best efforts to a fair trail.

    It is hard to believe in the face of two radically different testimonies from the two key witnesses ([Wilson](http://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7281165/darren-wilsons-story-side) and [Brown’s friend](http://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7287443/dorian-johnson-story) who was with him) that a court room wasn’t needed to figure out the facts and to assess guilt. With so much forensic evidence, a court room full of experts was the only hope we had of truly exonerating Darren Wilson if he is in fact innocent or convicting him of some sort of crime ranging from negligence to murder if he is in fact guilty.

    Wilson is not to be vilified. He is a police officer in a hard job dealing with hard problems and stubborn crime. He is part of system and is acting in ways the system accepts. Proving cold blooded murder in this case seems like it would have been tough, if not impossible. But proving a system that is failed, that unfairly targets minorities, that has made it too easy to shoot and kill a black man in this county would have not only be possible, but imminently worthy. It’s a conversation we need in this country.

    The system again failed us, because once again, a prosecutor guided the steps forward and got his wish, which really is the reason so much abuse in our industrialized prison system exists in the first place. Coupled with societal ignorance of the workings of the criminal justice machine and its indifference to the principles of justice the outcome is predictable. Reaction to the events in Ferguson only reveal the depth of our country’s misunderstanding of our criminal justice system. The passionate protests speak to cultural fear, but they fail to present reasoned solutions, as if simply locking up all the cops would help. Those who have suffered the most from systemic abuse can’t see any hope but to drag others down into the abuse with them. That is not reform.

    For all these reasons Ferguson, Missouri is not only not exceptional, surprising or isolated, but sadly too normal and too common to continue to ignore. The only thing that would be exceptional, surprising and isolated is a solution that empowers, rather than criminalizes, our culture. That is reform and that would be a shocker. This event, in every way, is anything but.

  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    On a winter night in the heart of Brooklyn they gather waiting for a bus that will drive them through the night to visit loved ones in far away prisons in the far northern tip of New York.

    Most know each other, even though many stand in small groups slightly apart from some and closer to others. It’s only when the bus arrives and the familiar jockeying for seats begins that the group becomes an unlikely community bound together by the hardship and bonds of being the family of those incarcerated.

    Tonight there are strangers in the mix: Four members of the Alliance of Families of Justice team, including executive director Soffiyah Elijah have signed up to ride, share the difficult experience with the family members and to use that time to connect. It isn’t easy at first.

    “Are you a cop,” one of the regular bus riders asks me as we wait to get on board.

    “Please,” I say with a pleasant laugh. “I’m formerly incarcerated. The exact opposite.”

    Her mood lightens, too.

    “Ok, just had to check, my bad,” she says.

    The group includes grandmothers in their 70s and kids of all ages. It includes many women whose only connection to their partner is on these weekend visits. The overnight bus ride (and return trip 24 hours later) will cost them $60 each (including a cost for the children) a nights sleep and the better part of their weekend. Many are working more than one job to compensate for their partner’s lost income.

    ![IMG 2272-300x225](//images.contentful.com/jo6vhcg97vhs/3iM4gAEuEU6OsgUo4qWGAW/7df9392c86a61f8fbdd43749840f2e6a/IMG_2272-300x225.jpg)

    These rides used to be provided by the state. Family connections remain one of the stronger positive factors in a positive and successful return to society by those who have been sent to prison. But with the exorbitant cost of phone calls, numerous discipline tactics that ostracize the person from his or her family, and the price now that the state quit paying for it, the connection between family and those inside prison is continually at risk.

    On the bus, the driver takes care to help families sit together and to ensure that everyone who bought a ticket has a seat. It’s not an easy task and often requires some negotiation as people are slid around like Tetris blocks, especially in the final stop in the Bronx where still more people wait to make the exhausting trek north.

    One of the regular riders also has the role of people management. She can be tough when she needs to, but she greets people with kindness. She closes with “OK Baby.” Everyone is in her family it seems. The bus is the better for it.
    Despite the winter cold, the bus becomes a heat box with so many bodies and poor temperature control within in. As the bus leaves the city, a call comes out from the back.

    “Please turn the heat down.”

    AFJ team members talk with those near them. At one point we distribute literature up and down the aisles, including the latest information about Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s announced plan to scale back visit days for families of those in maximum security prisons. Interest is high. Suddenly there’s no more concern about my being a cop. Many ask questions. Concern is high, but the resolve is higher.

    They ask for more copies and share them across the bus. We keep these bus riders in mind weeks later when the governor withdraws his plan to restrict visits. Advocacy has helped several on this bus continue to see the people they love.
    But, AFJ wants more than blocking regressive policies.

    “These bus rides used to be free. Now the add to the financial hardship of the families of those incarcerated,” Soffiyah Elijah says. “We want the free bus rides to return. Families are the key to successful re-entry and improved cultures inside the prisons. We need to do more for families to stay together, not less.”

    But all that comes later. For now, this bus riding community rides on. Some sleep. Kids play small video devices before nodding off. The miles pour on until in the wee hours of the morning, the bus pulls to a stop outside the Clinton Correctional Facility. Massive 35-foot concrete walls with rifle towers line the streets. As the bus doors open, bitter chill offers the only greeting. The bus driver gives instruction for the departure time later that afternoon after the visitation for the return trek back to the city.

    People file off the bus, uncoiling from the cramped spaces they left. They walk up toward the hill toward the prison. A loved one awaits.

  title: Law and Order President Threatens Both
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Long before the 2016 election, I wrote that the only bipartisan issue guaranteed to be on both platforms regardless of the candidate was criminal justice reform. Then along came the current president.

    On his inauguration, [several journalists were charged](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/24/journalists-charged-felonies-trump-inauguration-unrest) with unprecedented felonies for working during the protests against this administration. Against all the odds, common sense, morality and fiscal responsibility, the era of mass incarceration is alive and well.

    This "law and order" president will threaten every aspect of the Bill of Rights. He will loudly distract us with nonsense to divert attention to this strategy. And despite the chorus of opposition much of the resistance is fighting for turf. This threat seems too great to worry about such things. Is it hyperbolic to recall Benjamin Franklin, "unite or die?"

    The recent theocratizing of America represents a greater concern than even the embarrassment of a Trump presidency.  The conservative ideologues seem willing to tolerate the boorish incompetence of the current president, but only for as long as necessary to solidify power and control. If I had to gamble, I'd bet that Trump's demise comes from the GOP, not the Democrats. Conservative Republicans would love a polished, fervent, true-beliving Mike Pence in the seat of power before 2020. Does the "impeach" movement doesn't play right into their hands?

    Finally, Candidate Donald Trump refused to say he'd respect the election results. Then despite being walloped by the popular vote and with clear proof of Russian influence, he fixated on proving he won by even more votes. His
    priority to discredit voting in this country is bone-chilling for those who believe in democracy. For that circle of "friends" and modern-day Brutuses that surround our new Ceasar, one most wonder if they have overestimated their power to stab him.

    Can we reasonably expect a man with no respect for democracy to rightfully respect it and step down at whatever time his tenure in office legally ends? Any such assumption could be catastrophic. Vigilance from the outset is critical.

    These are the issues that compel me to action. A law and order president with no regard for the law should cause every last American citizen to give pause. Instead, divisions rise, and the opportunity for an unprecedented power grab grows.

    How do I step outside the noise and focus on what can make a difference? How do I take these issues and lend them to the conversation of what concerns others (the staggering ban on immigrants, the blatant attack on LGTBQ rights, the denial of climate change, the fraudulent nominee for Supreme Court, for example)? It's a question we all must ask or prepare for consequences we've never imagined possible.

    All great empires fall, and most do so from within.

  title: 'Rule #11: Avoid servitude'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    We like to look around at our modern, sophisticated world and think those awful stories of the history books, whose men enslaved other men and women, because of ethnic differences, skin color, or poverty, are relegated to the dusty past.

    We watch a gut-wrenching movie like *Twelve Years a Slave*,  and it feels so foreign to us, as if it didn’t happen right here in America in our not too-distant past, as if it doesn’t shape the roots of the culture we grew up in.

    Wishful thinking let me count the ways in this Rule #11.

    Of course, even today slavery is rampant, even right here in America. Sex trafficking remains a brutal, profitable business where young girls are sold into slavery and turned into prostitutes. My small-town newspaper did a story on a sex sting at a local hotel where all the prostitutes were under-aged Mexicans brought here in slavery, just as a national newspaper did a story about sex trafficking around the Super Bowl.

    There is slavery all over the world. Some of it is institutionalized and approved. Consider prisons. By law in most states inmates must work a legitimate work week. But they are not entitled to be paid the legal minimum wage. Most inmates make about $45 a month. Some as low as $30. Roughly a little more or less than a dollar a day. Slavery? In any other context except prison, the uproar would be global.

    If that’s not slavery, consider this. When inmates first arrive at Oregon State Penitentiary, they must work three shifts a day, serving food or cleaning tables, for 30 work days, roughly a month and a half, for absolutely no pay. It’s a trial system to prove you’ll be a good worker. Then you can get a “paying” job at those lofty wages I just mentioned.

    Is that slavery?

    Of course, they justify it by saying prisoners need to pay for their own lodging, a rate they say is $65 dollars a day. Never mind that in many of those cases the inmate offered to pay for his or her own incarceration through house arrest companies, that charge $25 a day, and allow the person to continue in their job making their full wage. The state in most cases refuses, forcing the person into the system of incarceration. We call it imprisonment, but it remains slavery.

    My cellmate Jacob had been in prison for the better part of a decade. He used every means at his disposal to avoid work because he said, ”I refuse to succumb to the fortress mentality. By working we sustain this system of slavery. I will not contribute to my own confinement.”

    He is completely correct. If every inmate simply refused to work the system would collapse in a month. They’d have to negotiate because the justice system Americans have voted for and approve of is unsustainable, by a long margin. If the state could not use slaves the Department of Correction would have all the staying power of cotton picking.

    So interesting as this may be, what does this have to do with a young person’s transition into adulthood, assuming of course that young person doesn’t intend to end up in sex trafficking, a third-world or communist country or in America’s prisons?

    Everything. The mindset of slavery reaches far beyond shackles and barbed wire, far beyond dirty hotel rooms with sleazy customers. Just look to America’s corporations. To America’s suburbs. To America’s debt.

    *We are a people enslaved by the American dream.*

    My generation, Generation X, grew up with the realization for the first time in American history our future did not look likely to outpace our parents. The American Dream – a big house, good job, early retirement, etc. and the basic belief our life would be better than our parents — crumbled under our feet as we reached adulthood. Our parents, that monstrous Baby Boomer generation, gobbled up the future of hope and optimism. Instead of bright futures, we reached adulthood with threats all around. Housing prices ballooned and were no longer affordable, while the glut of Baby Boomers kept a stranglehold on top-paying jobs. The ozone was cracking, we were told, and our planet was dying. To top it all off, two powerful countries had a button, which if pressed, could cause a nuclear holocaust destroying life as we know it.

    This was the broken future we saw on the landscape as we crossed into adulthood. Signature movies of our era captured our frustration, Reality Bites and St. Elmo’s Fire.  That was us. Mad as hell at our parents, rebelling against all the authority figures, railing against the rules of the game they created. This was part of the energy that spurred this book.

    Now twenty years later I realize this next generation faces the same problems we faced. This era looks more like mine than my father’s. On one hand, I’m frustrated we haven’t done more to correct the burden our parents left us. We’ve passed it on. But on the other hand, I embrace the camaraderie. The challenges I face, so does my son.

    The ozone is OK apparently but global warming seems to be the real deal. I had to wait in gas lines on odd and even days, but my children pay $4 dollars a gallon. The Soviet Union crumbled but terrorist’s blew up a bunch of shit, even topping the Twin Towers. Unemployment is a burden for me and my kids as the Baby Boomers refused to move along and give up their grip on the world.

    And the bottom line, my children must avoid servitude just as I’ve tried to. Look around. See the shackles? That car payment, that suburban home, those traffic jams, those credit card payments that extend into infinity. It’s all still there. The nine-to-five grind is more like seven-to-seven with commute time. Two weeks off a year. Really? Two whole weeks?? And we should be grateful?

    The rat race as it’s called has robbed us of so much that differentiates us as humans. We have little time to soak in beauty. We lose touch with our art. We scan computer screens and never read a book. We have a glut of information and so little knowledge. The only time we have to ponder is stuck in cars, which we clutter up with texts, calls, music and anger at the slow pace. That’s servitude. We don’t even realize we are our own captors.

    Redefine the American Dream. Live life on your own terms, rather than climbing the corporate ladder in search of having the most money, best house, coolest car and empty soul. For that is slavery. That is the cattle drive. Seek instead the road less traveled.

  title: Each one of the ‘More than 100 arrested’ needs scrutiny
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Right before the Fourth of July weekend, U.S. Marshals in Northern California released news of two weeks of arrests in a “sting” that rounded up “more than 100” wanted men in Sacramento, Oakland and surrounding areas.

    The news made little more than local briefs in Bay Area newspapers.  Though [television reports did a bit more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS2M6bpEIVw), giving it less than two minutes of air time, they still did nothing more than air the talking points of the U.S. Marshals and local police.

    Police apparently were targeting Northern California gang members and violent offenders.  Several high profile criminals, men wanted for rape and murder, were touted through the media reports, revealing just enough detail for those TV sound bytes.

    Here’s what hasn’t been released: The list of names of all those “more than 100” arrested, their ethnicity, their crimes and the reasons why they were targeted for this widespread sting.

    Once arrested nearly 75 percent will remain in jail in California, unable to post bond. It could take months for anyone wrongfully caught up in this sweep to actually prove their innocence.

    Who was targeted and why, is a vital question the media seems disinterested in asking. Were blacks and Hispanics unfairly targeted, compared to whites with similar crimes? Who was on the list and wasn’t arrested, also sounds like a compelling news story. Or, if gang members were targeted, how do we know they are actually guilty and not simply being arrested for being “associated” with gang activity by local police. Still further, if gang members were the target, why were only 27 of the “more than 100” actually gang members?

    To be clear, none of this is to say the arrests are unjust. It could well be exactly as the police spokespeople say, that this was a cost-effective, badly needed effort to bring notorious threats to public safety to justice. But what we shouldn’t do — especially in light of the police tactics commonly on display — is take their word for it.

    Also, politicians and political figures (like heads of departments like the U.S. Marshals) know well the “news cycle.” If you want to spin something a certain way, release it late on a Friday, or better yet, at the start of a holiday weekend, which just so happened to be the case with this carefully timed announcement.

    We may be the global leader in mass incarceration, but we are not Egypt were we convict by association and by the hundreds. The sheer numbers of this “more than 100” arrested should cause both concern and interest from both the media and the community who want to ensure that public safety remains accountable to the ideals of freedom and justice that this country just celebrated with fireworks and parades.

    If this was a great bust for public safety, then those involved should be more than willing to release the details of how it came to be. If not, those tasked with holding our government to account should simply do their job.

  title: Father of the story is still worth telling
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "> As Father’s Day rolls around I can’t help think of my
    father, who above all things has been “the story” in my life.\n> \n> Many times
    he’s the teller, grandiose and exuberant. More often he is the story itself, the
    larger-than-life figure that cast enormous shadows over my childhood and has been
    a constant presence through all the phases of my adulthood.\n> \n> Need a story
    to tell? I rifle through the “Dad” files. The septuagenarian with triplets is
    just a tip of his enormous iceberg of stories. His massive 6′-6″, three to four
    c-notes of weight frame is perfect for comic emphasis. His energy for life fills
    so many frames of my movie track. There’s always something he has dragged up from
    central casting. Something within those files of memories always works for whatever
    the situation may call for.\n> \n> On this Father’s Day, here’s one of my favorites
    from the greatest hits track of my life. I call it “Midnight Massacre.”\n> \n>
    Happy Father’s Day, Pop!\n\nLittle did I know life had afforded me a glimpse.
    Even now, with the luxury of three decades of experience, I don’t begrudge the
    fact I missed it. The insight from the moment that night at the altar was beyond
    me. Such sagacious wisdom in one so young could hardly be expected from a savant,
    let alone a stampeding bull of a knucklehead like me. I don’t count this opportunity
    lost.\n\nBe that as it may, my first night at the altar—with the benefit of hindsight—serves
    as an effective crystal ball to the arduous, circuitous, tumultuous—hell, just
    about any “ous” can be appropriately applied—spiritual journey that lay ahead.
    I look back and can see now what I could never have hoped to see then. Still,
    I look back at that well-intended boy, tears dribbling off his flushed, tired,
    chubby cheeks, and I wish I could warn him.\n\n“Pay attention son,” I’d say. “It
    doesn’t have to be like this. It doesn’t have to be this hard.”\n\nI consider
    this with a sigh of resignation. If I could send such a message to me way back
    then, I like to think that 12-year-old would listen. I believe his heart was still
    pliable, his ears still receptive, his desire still attuned to please. I know
    with even greater certainty that in just a couple of quick years such pliability
    would be lost. In a mere skipping stone of time across the sea of my life, by
    the time those around me begin to see the troubling signs, my ears had grown deaf
    to such well-intended guidance. Before I could (legally) drive a car I’d become
    fully adorned in my identity’s rebel uniform. From then on, I’d spend my time
    rushing headlong into life, a type of rebel yell on my lips, directly into the
    poised arsenal of failure prepared to drop me in my tracks.\n\n“Easy or hard,”
    life would ask me time and time again.\n\n“Hard,” I’d reply. Always hard.\n\nHow
    ironic it seems the last good chance to redirect this hell-bent course came so
    early, when I was far too young to pay the lesson heed. Still despite all opportunities
    lost, real or imagined, my night at the altar remains the opening scene, my first
    concrete spiritual memory of the rugged and ragged spiritual journey that continues
    today. The memory starts the sequence, repeated time after cruel time. Despite
    all else that might be true, one fact asserts itself: My first act of obedient
    service to the mystery we call God ended in public shame.  It would not be the
    last of such episodes, not in any way, not even close.\n\nThe DNA of Italian Catholic
    boys necessitates at least some consideration of the priesthood. If exceptions
    existed in the 1970s, when I was a child, I certainly didn’t know of them. Typically
    these subtle spiritual nudges (hopelessly intertwined with the more direct physical
    nudges of Italian mothers) come in those pre-pubescent years, Freud’s latency
    stage, the last great pause in a male’s insatiable thirst for the mysterious creature
    female, those beautifully simple dormant years where girls have cooties, your
    pals are demi-gods and the brotherly pursuit of Knights of the Round Table-like
    glory, or life among Robin’s Merry Men, seems idyllic. They come when “No girls
    allowed” signs are in vogue. In the absence of female’s intoxicating allure, we
    boys can dream noble dreams of heroism, selflessness, camaraderie and service.
    Uncertain of whether such jobs as knights or Merry Men still exist, priesthood
    provides Italian Catholic boys a tangible, practical alternative.\n\nI was typical
    in this regard. I don’t recall making the decision to pursue the priesthood. I
    knew my brother had already been a Cub Scout. I knew I needed to chart my own
    path. I doubted the Hardy Boys had openings to join. Somehow I fell onto the idea
    of becoming an altar boy at St. Denis Catholic Church  How very Catholic of me.
    How very Italian. Though I was the brat of the family, such a dynamic spiritual
    calling would clearly enhance my standing. I would be the loyal son now, the holy
    one. I remember the day I took the enormous, dusty, white, family Bible off the
    shelf where it was prominently displayed and decided to read it. All of it. Starting
    with Genesis 1. “In the beginning…”  I remember it clearly. I don’t remember ever
    making it to Genesis 2.\n\nStill, with great enthusiasm, I pursued my holy order.
    Upon being introduced to the altar boys, I met our supervisor/trainer, a black
    cassocked, decidedly creepy man named Mr. Lanier. He wore the working garments
    of a priest. Like the Phantom of the Opera, he could virtually always be found
    day and night lurking in the church shadows. Yet, he wasn’t a priest. Rumors abounded
    as to why. Speculation circulated continually among the altar boys, but one didn’t
    know for sure any more than we knew what his actual job was.  What we did know
    was Mr. Lanier was our drill sergeant, and we feared him accordingly. We knew
    he had dedicated himself to service of God and the church. We sensed intuitively
    such service didn’t come with joy. In fact, he seemed the angriest man I’d ever
    met. Anger and service. An odd, discordant, juxtaposition yet, surprisingly to
    me, one I’d come to see time and time again among God’s most ardent believers.
    I never have come to understand it better than I understood Mr. Lanier when I
    was 12.\n\nMr. Lanier performed his tasks with a permanent scowl etched across
    his face. We were his charges, his burden; perhaps we were his penance. He performed
    his tasks of training us with dour perseverance, his small eyes furtively scanning
    to and fro from behind thick, black spectacles. His flabby cheeks and sagging
    love handles, hung out of place on his otherwise thin frame, like everything else
    about this strange man.\n\nDo I factually recall he walked with a limp and was
    missing a couple of fingers? Or has the myth of this odd man grown through thirty
    years of faded memory? I search my mind and believe both to be true of a most
    unlikely candidate who would become by proxy my first spiritual guide.\n\nAfter
    completing my rigorous training a couple of afternoons a week, I became a full-fledged
    altar boy. I joined my first brotherhood, a host of cassocked-clad boys, ages
    12 to 17, who knew each other not at all from outside our Sunday morning duties.
    \ With great anticipation and trepidation I joined their ranks. Having learned
    the essential roles of the Mass, I was given a spot on the schedule, working in
    support of the priests, in front of the pew-packed church, offering the holy rituals
    that went back centuries. Mr. Lanier spared no words to convey that our charge
    was both simple and essential: serve the priests, those holy, distant, elaborately
    clad men we called “father,” without word, and especially without flaw. As my
    Dad had often commanded my brother and me whenever company came to visit, we were
    to be seen and not heard. Mr. Lanier enforced this command with a snarl. My father
    enforced it with a swat. Both scared me silly.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when
    I saw the schedule for my first Midnight Mass when Mr. Lanier posted it a couple
    of weeks prior to Christmas. He had chosen me as one of a dozen or so others to
    participate in the service widely recognized as one of the most significant of
    the year. Several priests took part in the impressive pageantry. A gaggle of altar
    boys flocked among them. Mr. Lanier even came out of the shadows to participate,
    shedding his workday black cassock for ornamental colored robes similar to those
    worn by the priests.\n\nI was given the role of candle-lighter. Candle-lighters,
    I learned, had two specific tasks during Midnight Mass. First, me and my co-candle-lighter
    would light the numerous candles all over the church prior to the start of the
    service, which of course began precisely at midnight on Christmas morning. It
    was imperative, Mr. Lanier stressed, that this task be performed without lighting
    myself on fire. The white, frilly blouse-like coverings we’d wear over our cassocks
    were highly flammable, Mr. Lanier stressed. With the abundance of extra candles
    displayed for Midnight Mass, the odds of connecting an open flame to one flammable
    altar boy increased exponentially to dangerous levels. The added pressure of lighting
    these candles in front of a church jam-packed with celebrants combined with the
    scandal of a burning altar boy on Christmas had Mr. Lanier’s taut nerves strained
    to the breaking point.  A fully involved, engrossed three-alarm altar boy would
    greatly dampen the blessed atmosphere of Midnight Mass, Mr. Lanier stressed. I
    don’t recall him stressing much concern for the fate of an altar boy daft enough
    to actually set himself ablaze. Mr. Lanier’s penetrating stare never diverted
    from me as he explained all of this, leaving no doubt who he suspected might just
    be daft enough to actually immolate himself. Knowing me, I absolutely shared his
    suspicion. With scrunched brow, I reluctantly raised my hand. \n“You have a question
    Mr. Bolsinger?” he asked suspiciously.\n\n“Uh, yeah, well….no…uh…never mind.”\n\nHe
    gave his head a brief shake; his eye glasses slipped a notch down his nose. After
    a prolonged thought, he decided to press on. Somehow I didn’t say—for once—what
    was on my mind, namely “Just why in God’s name did you pick me for this job?”
    I have little doubt that in that moment Mr. Lanier was asking himself the very
    same question. Why voice the obvious, I reasoned?\n\nOh Mother of Irony, what
    a sneaky sprite you are. Who would have thought that this most obvious of perils
    would not be my undoing, but the second, supposedly innocuous task required by
    the candle-lighters that would set my spiritual calling ablaze? Certainly not
    me, nor Mr. Lanier. Looking back I can’t help but wince at yet another opportunity
    lost at such an early age. How many times do I see this play out in the years
    to come, when my spiritual quest would not surrender in defeat to the obvious
    frontal assaults, but the craftier, less obvious, Trojanesque operations that
    would flay me from within?\n\nIndeed, this second task seemed so comparatively
    inconsequential Mr. Lanier breezed by it with just a few words of instruction.\n\n“You
    two candle-lighters will follow the procession forward from the very back of the
    church and carefully light each candle at the end of every row held by a parishioner.
    Do I have to actually say be careful not to spill hot wax on anyone?”\nHe shook
    his head and moved on.\n\nI’d seen this ritual every Midnight Mass I’d attended.
    The first candle in a row is lit. Then, the flame is passed down each row from
    one person to the next, row by row, until the whole church looks like an encore
    at a Bruce Springsteen concert, glowing in a  sea of tiny flames. I could handle
    this, I thought. Don’t spill wax on anyone. Easy enough. Or, so I thought.\n\nMy
    excitement bubbled over that Christmas Eve. We opened presents as was our family’s
    custom. We played raucously until it was time to get ready for Midnight Mass.
    I felt exalted because we had to leave for church early because of my very important
    role. For once my older brother would take a back seat to me.\n\nMy father attended
    Midnight Mass. This and Easter, in his mind, fulfilled his Catholic duty, especially
    since he wasn’t Catholic. When Dad married my mother, the daughter of devout Italian
    Catholic immigrants, he promised to raise his children in a proper Catholic home
    even if he was too stubborn to become Catholic himself.\n\nDad’s relationship
    to the church—much like his relationship to virtually everything he collided with
    in life—was far more conflicted than casual indifference. My Dad openly defied
    the authority of priests and church rules. His involvement with Catholics reached
    back to his teen years, far more intertwined than most agnostics. Though he exasperated
    priests, my father remained highly sympathetic.\n\nDad was just 13 when his father
    sent him away to a Catholic military boarding school. My grandfather wanted both
    discipline and opportunity for his rambunctious son, something widely missing
    from their home in the frontierland territory of 1950s Alaska. Of course, Dad
    despised the move. He rebelled when he could. He grew angry. He resisted both
    discipline and opportunity except for that which he chose. One such choice led
    him to the Catholic Church. My Dad learned that those volunteering to be an altar
    boy for the campus church would excuse him from much of the marching and drilling
    he despised. He volunteered. Nobody asked if he was actually Catholic. He wasn’t.
    Nevertheless, he learned the service by heart and served the priests loyally,
    right up to the time a visiting bishop required all altar boys say confession.
    My dad was stymied. He had no idea how to say confession, a required act of all
    Catholics from the time they hit second grade. The gig was up. The scandal of
    a non-Catholic altar boy earned my father weeks of extra drills and a reduction
    of rank. It earned plenty of red-faced heartache to the school’s hierarchy as
    well. My father stayed away from all but required church services from then on.
    \nToward the end of the school year my father’s world fell irrevocably off its
    axis. My grandfather died when the float plane he piloted crashed into an Alaskan
    bay. The news both devastated and defined my father. He chose to remain at the
    school he once despised, even refusing to leave on weekends, a decision he still
    can’t explain though likely came in an unconscious desire to please his now departed
    father.\n\nAwash in lonely grief, my father drew the attention of an Irish priest
    who ministered to the school and surrounding towns. The priest discovered my father
    was an accomplished altar boy. He wrangled some type of permission to have my
    father accompany him on his travels to area parishes in an unofficial capacity
    as a defacto altar boy. To whatever extent my dad’s wounds healed during those
    terrible days of grief, my father credits the hours spent driving around with
    an old, red-nosed boozy Irish priest who took the time to feel his pain. This
    odd pairing of broken boy and relatively discarded priest speaks as a witness
    to God’s creative, mysterious, healing ways. It also seared some degree of my
    father’s loyalty to the Catholic Church.\n\nYears later, my father took up an
    aisle seat in the pew to watch his young son follow in his unlikely footsteps
    as an altar boy, with pride most non-Italian, non-Catholics wouldn’t understand.\n\nIn
    the minutes before the start of Midnight Mass, I carefully and successfully lit
    the candles in my half of the church. I didn’t even singe a hair. As the service
    started I joined the priests and altar boys in an incense-filled processional,
    beaming with pride. It likely goes without saying that my father paid scant attention
    to a service he still knew largely by heart. His idle hands and wandering thoughts
    conspired to contort his candle into a work of art. Did anyone really expect the
    candle to remain unmolested in my father’s hands? Would a child if given Playdoh
    not instantly smash, shape and mold? I can’t help but think someone should have
    seen this coming. But I didn’t.\n\nDad’s work of art, he later claimed, was a
    snail. Upon my first glance—which came the moment our solemn assembly of priests
    and altar boys and Mr. Lanier awash in pageantry and incense, ushered past the
    pew my father sat in—I thought the once straight, innocent, white candle had been
    fashioned into something altogether un-snail-like. As I raised my candle to light
    his, my most serious, holy expression linked eyes with my father’s look of silly
    innocence. His eyes drifted to his candle. Mine followed. I touched my wick to
    what was left of his, not very snail-like candle I could envision only one thing,
    and like a typical 12-year-old, I lost it. A great chuckle roared from the depths
    of my gut at the thought of this phallus-like impostor waiting to be lit in my
    father’s hand. The laugh rose like rushing water only to be severely dammed up
    at the last moment by my clenched lips, desperately trying to block its intrusion
    into the holy, incensed-fumed quiet air of the church. I captured most of my reflex.
    The stifled laugh cracked through my body like an earthquake. My shoulders buckled.
    My eyes squinted. Only a tiny sound escaped, mixed with a rush of air from my
    lungs that slipped out before the gates of my mouth slammed shut. Nobody saw or
    heard anything except my father. But the escaped breath attacked, simultaneously
    extinguishing both my candle and my father’s, er…snail. \nNow Dad’s enormous shoulders
    buckled in happy mirth. My hands trembled from repressed laughter and sudden panic.
    I shocked the man behind my father as I reached back to relight my candle on his,
    the one I had just lit a moment before. He momentarily pulled back his candle
    as if I was trying to steal it. Undeterred, I jammed the end of my long gold candle-holder
    onto his candle to relight my flame.\n\nI tried again to relight the renegade
    shape in my father’s hand. Our efforts to connect acted like polarized magnets,
    pushing and pulling away from each other by the unseen force of our hidden joke.
    My candle nervously darted and dogged in pursuit of his, which ducked and dodged
    because of his silent cackles that incessantly juggled his hand. I shot a worried
    look over my shoulder at the departing processional, now at least four rows ahead
    of me.\n\nMy Mom began to assess the situation. A confused, yet not surprised,
    expression covered her face. Quickly she assessed the situation and thrust her
    calm hand toward me, her unmolested candle ramrod straight and still. I somehow
    managed to light it, barely avoiding lighting my father’s beard on fire. Her candle
    lit, she smacked my father’s shoulder and shooed me forward. Momentarily reprieved,
    I zipped through the next five rows with deftness and speed. I sighed a deep breath
    when I pulled back in line with the processional, even with the other candle-lighter,
    directly behind the ram-rod straight back of gimpy Mr. Lanier. I knew Mr. Lanier’s
    face had contorted into a sneer. He never missed anything. I’d hear about it later,
    to be sure. Nevertheless I had averted a scene. Compared with lighting the church
    on fire, he must have felt like he’d dodged a bullet with me. I could still feel
    the burn of his eyes, even though he couldn’t see me. I relaxed, just a bit, knowing
    there would be scant evidence to convict me. The procession continued. I lit another
    row of candles. I glanced up. About ten rows left.\n\nI sighed a small sigh of
    relief. And that’s when it happened. I allowed myself to replay the scene in my
    mind. The still stifled laugh, still desperate to escape having been thwarted
    in its frontal assault, opted for misdirection. The attacking chuckles rose slowly,
    evasively, building stealth energy like a determined team of Navy Seals. I snickered.
    I snarled. I convulsed just a little. Soon, I was overrun. The mixture of giggles
    and nervous tension proved far too intoxicating to suppress. Full laughs escaped
    in fits and starts, each time blowing out my candle. The more I tried to regain
    my composure, the more unhinged I became. Trying to light and relight the candles
    became nearly impossible. The laughs grew like confident demons, something apart
    from me, invading me with unrelenting persistence that caused consternation yet
    a deeply satisfying sense of joy. Soon a brown-out caused by my struggles consumed
    nearly three rows. The combined murmur of the crowd picked up a backdrop beat
    against my stifled laughs, soon joined harmonically by Mr. Lanier’s sneer. The
    invading sounds rose to the level of distraction with the priestly incantations.
    From the center of the procession, just as they began their ascent to the altar,
    the monsignor noticed me. I noticed him. I noticed his eyes shout toward Mr. Lanier’s,
    with the intensity of a cracking whip.\n\n“Leave!” the old priest mouthed, barely
    audible. \n\nMr. Lanier’s hand grabbed my collarbone. His other hand took my candle,
    which he deftly handed off to another boy. In a flash, he escorted me up the altar
    and out, never releasing his Spock-like grip.\n\nBack stage, I burst into tears.\n\nThe
    rest remains a blur. I refused to be consoled. My shame smothered me. After the
    service, my mother and father retrieved me. I recall tense conversation between
    my parents and Mr. Lanier. Perhaps the parish priest was there but I can’t recall
    for sure because I refused to look up from my personal lament, arms covering tear-splotched
    face, hunkered in a corner of shame. Eventually, my father scooped me up. We went
    home.\n\nI never again returned to the fellowship of the altar boys.  For the
    first time, but not close to the last, my spiritual calling lay in twisted wreckage."

  title: 'Rite of passage to adulthood: murder'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "It has long struck me as odd that the surest, quickest,
    truest way to become an “adult” in American culture is to kill someone.\n\nI can’t
    help thinking about Travis Gallo, a child who I can only presume is facing life
    in prison because he will likely be tried as an adult for the murder of his adopted
    sister the day after Christmas. His rite of passage into adulthood is the difference
    between a twenty-year sentence with the hope of rebuilding his life someday and
    spending his entire adulthood behind bars.\n\nWe lack rites of passage. Adulthood
    is muddled at best and far too often delayed, which is part of the motivation
    behind my book, “Rules 101”. Yet legally the rights of anyone under the age of
    18 are stridently protected and limited as children with the notable exception
    of being tried as an adult.\n\nIsn’t it interesting that if you kill someone,
    even in an act of rage, you go to adulthood — and jail — do not pass Go, do not
    collect $200.\n\nThe age of adulthood in these cases keeps getting younger and
    younger with nobody seemingly interested in exploring the hypocrisy.\n\nI did
    a search and found three states that tried boys as young as 12 under adult laws.
    H[ere was one](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-02-26/young-murderer-gingerich/53251806/1):\n>
    Paul Henry Gingerich awoke on the morning of his 14th birthday to the sound of
    a voice — his prison guard.\n> \n> “Happy birthday,” she said.\n> \n> It was 6
    o’clock. Paul would just as soon been given a few more minutes to sleep.\n> \n>
    But in a place where he must ask permission to go to the bathroom, where he eats
    every meal under close surveillance and where birthdays aren’t much different
    from any other day, it was a nice gesture for one of the state’s most controversial
    inmates.\n> \n> Paul Gingerich is believed to be the youngest person in Indiana
    ever sentenced to prison as an adult.\n> \n> He was still 12 years old when he
    arrived here at the Pendleton Juvenile Correctional Facility, the state’s maximum
    security prison for children.\n\nGingerich still faces a potential life of freedom,
    though the challenges of preparing for that life which he’s already experienced
    in prison and that which still awaits is daunting. Well, that’s an understatement.
    But he has hope. Perhaps the many volunteers who routinely go to prisons to push
    back against the dehumanizing culture will claim him and guide him through the
    desert of this darkness within him and the darkness he lives in. Perhaps.\n\nIt’s
    a powerful word. A word inmates know well. Perhaps. It suggests hope. Often hope
    is all an inmate has left.\n\nDoes Travis Gallo still have hope? I can’t imagine
    what his adoptive family is experiencing. They lost a sister/daughter when Travis
    stabbed Teia to death. But they also lost Travis, at least in part. How much depends
    on two things: 1) themselves first and foremost, and 2) whether he will be tried
    as an adult.\n\n*Note: This decision has been made, but finding it on the Internet
    has proved elusive. The national coverage that swarmed at the news of suburban
    murder has lost interest just as fast. You can’t find a current article. Even
    the local paper appears to have lost interest, which is a staggering indictment
    of the lack of journalism these days. The Bergen County prosecutor hasn’t released
    a press release since the event happened, at least one I can find. I hope I’m
    wrong. Prove me wrong. Because I’d really like to know. Travis Gallo’s life still
    matters now that the scandal has left our click-driven media interest.\n\nIn reading
    about the Gallo’s they appeared to be a close-knit family full of generosity and
    faith. I wonder, does that faith extend far enough to Travis now, locked in a
    jail cell, awaiting a sure-fire trip to the harshest prisons in New Jersey? Just
    how difficult it could be for them, even as Teia’s natural sister, also adopted
    remains one of their large clan. How do they care for her as a victim, themselves
    as victims and still remain the only family Travis knows? It’s a question I raised
    the other day: Can we care for the criminal without wounding the victim? We have
    to find a way.\n\nCan the Gallo’s find a way? My heart goes out to them.\n\nI
    can also relate. I grew up in a similarly mixed-race home. My younger brother
    was one of the few blacks in our L.A. suburb, tucked next to a largely black neighborhood
    on one side and an Hispanic on the other. True segregation came in the 1980s as
    our Inland Empire became a true melting pot. But in our 1970s, my brother was
    isolated.\n\nHe was angry. He was troubled. He had his run-ins with the law. But
    thankfully he never committed murder. He was never tried as an adult while still
    a child. He grew up. He joined the Navy, and then kicked a drug habit. He raised
    a daughter largely on his own and became a drug counselor. He led the way to recovery
    for me long before I got there myself.\n\nWhen he died much to young he left a
    legacy of promise and hope, a testament to what can be done when we are allowed
    to grow up.\n\nWe need new rites of passage. We need consistent laws. We need
    to allow children to grow up, even when terrible things happen.  We need to revisit
    this message we send when we try children as adults.\n\nIs it too late for Travis
    Gallo? Perhaps. But perhaps not. And that… that perhaps not, is all the difference."

  title: " True reform: make prison profits transparent"
  author: Reggie Clemons
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The United States Supreme Court has made rulings that grant increasing secrecy to the U.S. prison system, while removing accountability. For example, one such ruling declared prisoners have no constitutional right to rehabilitation. This decision lets prison officials spend billions of taxpayer dollars annually without accountability for the expenses or the results of its primary task to rehabilitate.

    Does society have a right to expect the money it spends on criminal justice directly lead to prisoner rehabilitation before release? One would think so.

    The prison system is one of the top pillars of civilization. It is the prison system’s sole responsibility to keep the public safe and reduce crime.

    Yet all evidence suggests it fails in its mission. One explanation may be the priority the prison system–which has become an industry–places on profits. Tax dollars and prison labor combine for big prison profits for prison operators and vendors, turning value for Wall Street shareholders that, in effect, own the prison system. The rights of taxpayers and the human rights of prisoners are secondary to profit-sharing. To protect their financial interest, these businesses funnel the profits to politician and judges, some of whom are shareholders as well.

    The prison system has become more about warehousing the neglected and poorly educated for profit than about crime reduction. This cold reality shows a priority that puts profits over mission, money over broken families, and power over reform.

    This is demonstrated in big and small ways. For example, guards mistreat prison visitors to discourage families from keeping up with what’s going on in prison.

    Many prisoners have to purchase their own basic needs from hygiene to clothing to food to compensate for what the prison system does not provide. This impacts their families who already pay taxes.

    Reform will only come with transparency about prison profits. One of the most powerful and influential ways to turn this prison-for-profit system around is transparency of all prison dollars spent.

    All financial records, invoices and contracts need to be published for public review on the Internet. A budget doesn’t properly disclose actual payments and the beneficiaries of those payments.

    Further, without transparency people can’t make knowledgeable decisions about where savings could be made, how money is spent now and where it all goes.

    With financial scrutiny, there could be greater savings and cost reductions, which should be returned to the taxpayers, instead of having prison profits–a phrase that shouldn’t even exist–benefit Wall Street shareholders.

    It’s a simple way to ensure that all the talk about prison reform turns to meaningful action.

  title: 'Pelshaw touts win/win: Hire felons'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    A midwestern real estate broker and entrepreneur worth several millions of dollars headed into The Great Recession. In those desperate times, all too familiar for so many, he shifted funds from one business to the next and back in the age-old, all-too-familiar story of robbing Peter to pay Paul.

    What isn’t too familiar (but becoming more so) was when the feds indicted the businessman on felony charges for improper use of SBA loan funds.

    But here’s the irony: The solution for the millionaire businessman named Robert Pelshaw was to pay back the loan, in effect, buy his way out of the legal problems. If he did, he was told, the charges would be resolved without prison time. But when you feel so desperate as to rob Peter to pay Paul, it’s a good bet that Robert doesn’t have the money to pay back Peter. Pelshaw went to Leavenworth for nine months because the former millionaire couldn’t buy his way out of trouble.

    So much of our “justice” system lacks exactly that.

    The irony is not at all lost on Pelshaw. But rather than wallow, Pelshaw is enthusiastically rebuilding his life by trying to help others rebuild their lives. He spent his 10-month sentence writing a book for those he met inside Criminal U.  The book, *[Illegal to Legal: business success for (ex) criminals](http://www.illegaltolegal.org/buy-book/)*, is a practical handbook to help ex-inmates truly become ex-criminals by starting small businesses of their own.

    He also launched a national campaign to motivate employers to hire felons. [The National Hire Ex-Felons Campaign](http://maltajusticeinitiative.org/the-national-hire-ex-felons-campaign-by-bob-pelshaw/) raises awareness of the benefits of hiring felons and dispels the myths that perpetuate a permanent lower class of those who have been formerly incarcerated.

    Pelshaw has infectious energy focuses on reforming the re-entry process for inmates getting out, a process that to date does little more than keep people under supervision, limit their options and funnel them back into prisons. Nearly nine of ten of those re-arrested are unemployed. Simple logic tells us that jobs are the key to reducing crime and truly rehabilitating those who need it.

    We are pleased that Pelshaw will be joining Criminal U as a correspondent. He will  post here from time-to-time on relevant topics of how ex-inmates can get jobs and become a part of the solution. We encourage you to [check out his website](http://www.illegaltolegal.org/) and share his posts that you read here through your social networks. Write a review for Illegal to Legal, and send a copy to a loved one inside who is starting to think about life beyond the barbed wires and bars of America’s prisons

    Politicians and various influential people have begun to raise awareness of the need for prison reform. But at least to date, much of what is being offered as “solutions” is far short of the creative, exhaustive reset that is needed in our criminal justice system. To be effective, to truly throw a wrench in the gear of the industrialized prison machine, innovators like Pelshaw who have seen the system from the inside need to be involved. Until we “hire” ex-inmates to help fix the system, until we tap into the deep talented pool of those who have been behind bars, we perpetuate the same mistake that keeps so many felons unemployed and underutlized.

    A Criminal U reunion conference with alumni from all spheres of public influence should be gathered in a conference to seek genuine solutions. Until the rich talent of those who screwed up and are motivated to give back– people like Pelshaw and a who’s who of American culture– are tapped to fix the system, our efforts of reform will come up short.

    In the end, no matter what solutions we discover, they will always circle back to the basic need of a job. Here too, Pelshaw has much to offer.

  title: 'Rule #13: Spend time more wisely then dollars'
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Spend time more wisely then dollars. And be generous with both.

    Money and time. These are the obsessions. One thousand years from now when technology has made us all immortal, they may not care any more about time, but I’m guessing money will still twist even our robot-selves into knots. We view the world through shades of green.

    If one thing causes most of us to obsess above all else, it is money. I have seen otherwise healthy people turn into Frankenstein over it. We’d seemingly eat our young to have more of it.

    It’s a trap. Yeah, yeah, we say. We know all about the trap and the down side and the scads of stories of those whose lives became a living hell over the worship of money. Then we go right on and stick our hands into the trap.

    Consider this one of those flashing warning signs “Danger ahead.” It is no coincidence Jesus said it is harder for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter heaven. Remind wealthy American Christians about this and uniformly they slip into Biblical gymnastics about metaphor and illustration and all sorts of other explanations of why Jesus didn’t really mean what he said. Press them further and like a cracking witness on the stand, they’ll shout out, “Yes but it is not impossible for the camel! Right? Anything is possible with Jeee-sus!”

    Don’t get me wrong, money is wonderful — one of the good things in life. With it you can eat great foods, drink better wine, live with views, travel, play well and do acts of good will. It would be hypocritical of me to turn legalistic about money when my very point is to avoid such legalism in other relevant topics like love, sex, faith, morals, and lifestyles.

    For the record I think Jesus was merely stating the obvious. In our culture we have a bumper-sticker saying that says the same thing: “You can’t take it with you.” We all enter heaven with our green security blankets left behind. Jesus’ statement also cut to the heart of our problems, namely greed. By simply reminding the rich man how dear his money was, how he worshiped it more than anything else, he was pointing to the trap, the false security that this man’s wealth had become.

    It’s likely beyond the scope of this book, but the subject of the rich young ruler is idolatry… money is the verb.

    The point here is perspective, which brings us to the reason time is coupled here with money in this rule. It’s a question of importance, of priority, of perspective.

    You know the old card game “Bullshit?” People try to bluff their hands and when their opponent thinks they’ve caught them in a lie, they yell out “Bullshit.” It’s fun. We’d be better off if we used such basic communication skills in every day life. For example, how often do we hear, “I’d love to but I am so busy. I don’t have time.”

    “BULLSHIT!” B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T!”

    Call it like you see it. If there is one truism I’m sure of in this world it’s that we generally make the time for what is most important to us. If we work 90-hour weeks, it’s because it’s important to us, either the way it satiates our ambition, or lines our pockets, or inflates our ego, or hides us from folks we don’t want to see, like our spouses, for example. How many young couples, head-over-heels in love, don’t somehow squeeze time for each other? A two-hour phone conversation with a new lover is as easy as a nap on a winter day, so why is it that two years later a ten-minute phone call is filled with awkward silences between the same people?

    Time doesn’t lie. Even more than money, y*our heart is where you spend time*. Money has power and sway and seduces us constantly but it lacks the same sense of True North that time holds in our world. Time is a compass of our inner desires. Not sure what is most important to you?

    Look first at your last few bank statements. They’ll tell the tale of your inner tape. Why do I not flinch each month when such a huge chunk of my money is used to pay for my home? Because I’m in love with my city. High-rent prices be damned.

    But if you really want to know what is important to you look at your time check book register. Where your time went, well that really tells the tale of the tape. Together, you have a pretty good picture of who you are and how you want to leave your mark on this world.

    The challenge is to spend both time and money wisely as a reflection of your goals, morals and relationships.

    When push comes to shove, pay even more attention to how you spend your time. You can always make more money. Time is like sand in an hourglass, slipping away. You have only what destiny has afforded you. If that third hour of television is that important to you, so be it. Just don’t bullshit yourself.

    The challenge of life is to be generous whether its time or money or both. Cultivate a true generous spirit and I suspect you’ll live a more abundant life. I think the reason the book Tuesdays with Morrie  was such a tremendous best-seller was due to how it tapped into a hidden wellspring within each of us that flows with our better selves. Morrie’s generous spirit permeates the book and infuses into the heart of the author. Yet it only happened — and thereby passed along to millions -– because of the author’s investment of time. There is no hidden passage around time. Invest it in creative energy of life and it will return dividends of relationship, wisdom, contentment and joy. Fail to do so and those things will return bankrupt.

    “Quality time” is an idol of American greed. Quality time comes from time spent, from the journey, from footprints left behind side by side, not from text messages and tweets.

    A generous spirit toward time and money is a surefire way to avoid the trap and its power to enslave you. I think it truly is the freedom trail of life. I hope so anyway.

  title: 'Q&A: Author, inmate, activist Halim Flowers'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Halim Flowers was a child, sentenced as an adult, when his education at Criminal U began. But what he’s done with it, how he’s made himself into the man he is now, is remarkable. Flowers is living proof of the human spirit, which as you read this you’ll see how far he’s come.

    __CriminalU: Everyone that goes inside has to make a choice about how they will do the time. You have made the choice to make it meaningful (what I call, you chose to survive well). When did that change occur within you and how did it come about?__

    Halim Flowers: I was raised in DC when it was the murder capitol. The crack era plagued the village, violence and despair everywhere. I was locked up for aiding and abetting a felony murder when I was 16 years of age and charged and sentenced as an adult. During my stay at the jail, Blowback Productions did the Thug Life In DC documentary on Andre Bruno and I as minors in adult jails and prisons.

    During my stay in prison, I have gained an understanding on the ripple effects for my drug dealing and violence in my community. I have developed contrition for my past actions that I show daily through my works with youth in prison and in society.

    __How have you connected with people outside to help you with your books and to get the story out?
    __

    I was blessed to be surrounded by good older men when I came to jail initially. My focus has always been on staying healthy and returning to society, so these brothers mentored me and assisted me with maintaining my focus. They taught me criminal and constitutional law, which helped me to overturn three of my convictions on appeal pro se. They trained me to exercise, eat the right foods, and to abstain from drugs and alcohol abuse in prison.

    When I went to state prison when I was sentenced at the age of 17 after staying at the DC Jail for a year. My thoughts attracted me to constructive people. Even officers assisted me with working out and giving me good books to read.

    I have connected with people on the outside by reading articles in various business and social periodicals such as Ebony, The Wall Street Journal, Black Enterprise, The Nation, etc., and writing letters to people that I read interesting articles about. I write a lot of professors, socialpreneurs, and writers to build social capital. A lot of prisoners become recidivist because they are poor in social resources that can facilitate their transition into society successfully. So, I network to build those human resources and it helps me to get my message and books out abroad.

    __What do you do each day to pass the time. What’s your routine? How long have you been at the prison you are in? Did you move around much?__

    Each day, I tutor GED students, read newspapers, exercise, pray, write, meditate, email with others about my life and conversate with progressive people in here. I spend my days letting the inmates and staff read my books, new writings that I am working on, and engaging in character building exercises like resolving conflicts and mentoring young brothers. I have only been in USP Atlanta for 10 months and its open so I can move around a lot within the institution.

    __When you hear of the prison sentencing that is taking place, how do you feel? Do you feel hope or that it will pass you by because so much of it is focused on “non-violent” crime?__

    I believe that the practice of sentencing juveniles to long sentences is reducing, so that is a plus. Most juveniles sentenced as adults like myself have violent offenses. The whole non-violent movement is a veneer because the nature of the crime doesn’t determine the character of a person today that has reformed their personal issues that made them a menace to society. So, this distinction will eventually be corrected because it isn’t accurate for an assessment for re-entry into society and all imbalances and fallacies will eventually be corrected.

    __Someday you will go before the parole board, is that correct? When is that and how do you feel about? I knew a lot of lifers who found the process so difficult, from hopes being raised and dashed. What’s your approach.__

    Yes, as of now I am scheduled to see the parole board in 2026. I feel that I have done everything to be released sooner than that, and the juvenile laws are changing in my favor. If I have to wait until then, the only thing that I can control is my thoughts and behaviors to reflect that I am suitable for release. I cannot control their decision.

    __What haven’t I asked you about yourself that you’d like to make sure any story about you includes?__

    A lot of my story is reflected in my books, especially my memoir that should be published next month. I have covered my entire life in [my books](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Halim Flowers), so nothing is missing or unwritten besides the new growth that I encounter everyday. My books detail my experiences extensively.

  title: Woman charged with manslaughter after police kill her boyfriend
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I’ve taken this story out for a test run a few times just to see what the response will be. I do this from time to time, just to gauge a little slice of reader reaction to what I write. I tried this one three times. All three had the *exact same response*.

    You try:

    “A 21-year-old woman, Regan Jelks, was riding in a car with her boyfriend, Taemarr Walker, when they came upon a police car with its lights on tending to an abandoned vehicle. A tow truck blocked the road. The boyfriend tried to pass and drove into a ditch, attracting the attention of the officer. As he approached the car, the officer said he saw a gun. A war of words broke out with the police officer telling the man several times to put his hand where he could see them. When Walker lunged for a gun, the officer shot and killed him. The woman was eventually pulled from the car screaming ‘Please don’t kill me.’ Her family says she had gun powder residue and wounds from the shattered glass on her face from the gun shots. Police cuffed her without giving her medical assistance and shoved her into a police car,” I say.

    “She is now being charged with involuntary manslaughter of her boyfriend,” I say.

    What’s your response?

    All three I asked said the same thing: “How can they do that?”

    Exactly.

    [This one is a head scratcher](http://www.yourblackworld.net/2014/04/black-news/woman-charged-for-de%CE%B1th-of-her-boyfriend-who-police-sh%CE%BFt-and-k%CE%B9lled/). No, actually, as I re-think it, it’s not a head scratcher at all. It’s an abomination.

    Police issued a six page statement about the killing of Walker– a known gang member in Ohio who was wearing latex gloves carrying a rifle and a handgun at the time of his death. A nearby bar had closed down early because Walker had threatened to shoot the place up. Police clearly believe he was headed that way.

    But the same report mentioned only that Jelks was being charged some six months after the incident. It also said it would offer no further information until the case is resolved. In other words, they’ll use the media to clear the name of their police officer but don’t expect us to explain our work to you — the very taxpayers who pay our salaries.

    Police also now see Jelks as an accomplice. They had her arrested in Detroit and brought back to Ohio. They made her walk the shackled perp walk to her arraignment.

    Which still begs the question how do you charge her with involuntary manslaughter?

    This is how police work these days. They twist the laws they are sworn to uphold to coerce a maximum sentence. The threat then makes the person — in this case Jelks, who her family says has no prior criminal convictions — scared enough to play ball.

    The gun charges against Jelks carry a maximum sentence of 18 months, according to the police report. The manslaughter ratchets that up to 11 years. Which do you think is more scary? Which do you think will force a plea deal and avoid having to take this crappy case before a jury?

    A local story after Jelks arraignment offered a headline that said the charges were now more clear.

    “The involuntary-manslaughter charge says Jelks caused the death of Walker ‘as a proximate result of … committing or attempting to commit’ the felony of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle,” .

    This of course explains very little. The firearms in the car weren’t hers. There has been no evidence cited that her fingerprints were on the gun. The guns were not used in the killing of her boyfriend. The police officer’s gun did that.

    So why bother? That’s the question. Why pull this gal with few ties to the area back on such spurious charges? Why incur the costs?

    Here you have to read between the lines a bit. In the aftermath of this shooting, gang violence escalated to the point, “Following the shοoting, the city of Warren experienced a spree of violence where some actions were thought to be in retaliation to the shooting. Warren Mayor Doug Franklin enlisted the help of the Ohio State Highway Patrol to monitor the streets and called for peace in the city.” .

    But it gets even clearer at the bottom of the aforementioned news article, which stated: “Meanwhile, Walker’s older brother, TaShawn Walker, 26, of Baytown, Texas, was in Judge Kontos’ court Monday for a hearing on his murder charge in the death of Richard Rollison IV, 24, of Niles.

    “Rollison was killed at a West Market Street gas station almost exactly one week after Taemarr Walker was killed.”

    How convenient. A murder charge against the brother of Walker in the same court as Jelks, a brother being held in the same jail, where people talk and where desperate recorded phone calls are made and where scared people like Jelks will talk about big things like murders that she may know little about.

    Suddenly the whole case against Jelks isn’t confusing at all.

    A [campaign to raise legal funds](http://www.gofundme.com/8dc35g) for Jelks has been started. The family has raised $3,000 toward its goal of $7,000. More is likely needed because a good attorney can do more than any one else right now to throw a gear in the wheel that turns lives upside down with trumped up charges simply to coerce cooperation.

    In a just system of justice, the end does not justify the means.

  title: Iron sharpens iron on other side of bars
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    It’s a cold Sunday morning in New York and Tony Yarbough had finally had a few moments to breathe. From the minute on Feb. 6 when a Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice declared Tony innocent of a triple murder, life became a blur.

    For the previous twenty-two years he had spent in the rigorous structure of Attica Correctional Facility. Now, the entire world opened in in full high-definition color.

    “Everything’s so big,” Tony told me, trying to describe the overwhelming feelings and experiences that had confronted him since his release.

    “I’m still finding my bearings, you know what I’m saying? I didn’t think about it until I got out. I have no place to stay. I have no bank account. It’s extremely weird.”

    Tony’s plight was helped considerably by his friend Eric Barden, who got out of Attica in 2008. They were bunkies. Unlike so many bunkies who promise the world and then promptly forget those left inside, Eric stayed true.  He reached out to attorney Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma and told him about Tony. Margulis-Ohnuma is the real deal, a criminal defense attorney with juice. He’s the type of attorney a guy like Tony can never get. But unlike many successful attorneys, Margulis-Ohnuma donated time to people who can’t afford a good attorney. He took on Tony.

    Today, Tony is free. Eric was waiting for him, having found him a temporary place to say. Still doing the work that so many bunkies promise to each other but rarely do.

    “I got him,” Eric told me, a saying we use inside often, but is often little more than words. In this case, it’s gold.

    Tony said he is trying to figure out how to use the smart phone Eric bought him.

    “Don’t worry,” I told him. “My smart phone makes me feel like a dummy.”

    Tony called Eric over who quickly got on the line, assuring me he’ll teach up his friend. We shared a good laugh.

    Tony and Eric are a long, long way from Attica when they last roomed together. But as the scriptures say, “Iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.”

    Eric told me the same thing. He’s been struggling with life on the outside for several years, but succeeding. He’s beaten long odds and hasn’t gone back inside.

    “Tony coming out is the right timing for me. He can help me stay on the path, and I can help him,” Eric said.

    Exactly, I said. We’re all in this together. Life is hard on the outside. “It’s big,” as Tony said.

    But no matter what the challenges, I reminded Tony, “you’re not inside. It’s all better than that.”

    “Oh yeah,” he said. “Amazing. That’s so true.”

  title: If Harvard says so, it must make sense right?
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard Kennedy School has a truly [admirable program](http://www.ash.harvard.edu/Home/News-Events/Press-Releases/Innovations-in-American-Government-Award-Finalists-Announced2). It lists 25 nominees and eventually awards five grant winners for “exemplary models of government innovation and advances” in addressing the nation’s most pressing public concerns.

    The five finalists were announced Tuesday. The winners tackled issues from transforming city services to residents in Boston, to identifying “high-risk trucks” without interfering with roadside commerce in New Mexico. The program, in existence since 1985, awards winners with grants and recognition that helps bolster its efforts.

    That’s all truly commendable, but it’s not what we’re reading today. One of the 25 nominees caught our attention. The 25 nominees were vetted from hundreds of applicants to truly represent the best and brightest ideas around the country.

    Only one program among the top 25 specifically attacked the epidemic of American incarceration. This program, Hawaii’s Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE), has garnered a lot of press for its successes in reducing positive drug test, missed supervision appointments, and fewer probation revocations. Police organizations and criminal justice organization love it. It’s often considered the best thing we have going and as many as 17 other states are following Hawaii’s lead. The nomination of HOPE gives it Harvard’s seal of approval as well.

    But here’s the disconnect: As a story on [Law & Industry Daily](http://bizlawnews.com/multimedia/40086/innovative-justice-program-spurs-similar-models/) makes clear, states buckling under the weight of the massive prison build-up over the past two decades are now desperate to cut back costs. Hawaii’s program is popular because, as the Kennedy announcement states, it “allows a single judge to supervise nearly 2,000 felony offenders…”

    How do they do this? HOPE “delivers swift, certain, and proportionate jail consequences for each probation violation.” PBS reports that unlike most probation programs “where dozens of violations may go without punishment, if probationers in H.O.P.E. skip a drug test or meeting with their supervisor, they will be sent to jail for a few days immediately.”

    The state of Kansas has taken HOPE even farther. It passed a law that gives the unfettered power to incarcerate to a parole officer for short stays without a judge’s order. In other words, this program reduces time in courtrooms, but it increases the revolving door of jail. It may be effective in reducing the numbers going to prison for longer sentences, but such data is not as easily found as numerous news stories touting Hawaii’s success.

    So just how exactly does this reduce the right of incarceration? How does this help stop the cycle of recidivism? Taking someone struggling with addiction and locking them up on a moment’s notice may seem like shock therapy designed to snap them out of it. But addiction is a disease and this disease doesn’t listen to reason. That’s why millions and millions of American’s struggle with addiction.

    But when every relapse, every missed appointment – a car breaks down, a bus is missed, an employer calls you into work, or just plain disorganization that addicts in particular suffer from – and every mistake lands the person in jail, the problems likely escalate. For some it may be exactly the discipline and structure they need. But for a great many it takes an eraser and wipes out the small strides they may have made to put their life in order. A short jail sentence is like setting off tear gas in their home. They will lose their job. They will miss obligations. They will disrupt their home lives and torment their children. Everything is turned upside down by even a short jail sentence. Making it easier to toss addicts into jail, may reduce court costs, but it does very little to combat the true nature of the problem, the addiction and the poverty it brings. The cost of that person on the entire system – food stamps, unemployment benefits, health care costs, disability – make the cost of a little more time in front of a judge pale by comparison.

    If this is the best Harvard can find, it is indeed a sad commentary on the current state of affairs.

    Brad Pitt once listed America’s prison explosion as his number one item on a list of things he’d change. He told Esquire Magazine, “We spend $40 billion a year on the drug war and $8 billion incarcerating people, 25 percent of whom are in there for drugs. Think of all the other things we could do with that money.”

    Though Pitt’s numbers are actually low, he gets it. If Brad Pitt can get it, why can’t Harvard?

  title: Recorded Inmate Calls With Attorneys Latest Breech
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "For an organization built strictly on the need to follow
    society’s rules, I can never get past how often those within the criminal justice
    system ignore them.\n\nThe lines of black and white — so called guilt or innocence
    — are so deftly painted when it comes to prosecuting someone for a crime and then
    continuing to punish them long after their so-called debt to society is paid.
    But when those lines are drawn around those in charge, suddenly they resemble
    the fluidity of abstract art.\n\nCase in point: Inmate calls to their attorneys.\n\n>
    A sheriff’s department in Texas recorded what should have been private phone calls
    between lawyers and inmates, and provided prosecutors with copies of the conversations,
    a federal lawsuit alleges.\n> \n> Such a breach would violate the attorney-client
    legal privilege and may have hindered the ability of lawyers to defend their clients
    in court.\n> \n> “They have a basic duty to maintain the structure of the legal
    system,” lawyer Brian McGiverin said, referring to the Travis County sheriff’s
    office and prosecutors. “Confidentiality of conversations with an attorney is
    simply one of the most fundamental rights we have.”\n> \n> The scope of the alleged
    spying is unknown and is believed to be ongoing, according to McGiverin. Lawyers
    in Austin began learning of the monitoring in Travis County’s two jails, operated
    by Sheriff Greg Hamilton, within the past year.\n> \n> The recordings sometimes
    came to light during the discovery phase of trials, when the prosecution must
    share all relevant materials with the defense. The lawsuit accuses other prosecutors
    of secretly using the recordings to “their tactical advantage without admitting
    they obtained or listened to the recordings.”\n> \n> The plaintiffs are four criminal
    defense attorneys in Travis County, the Austin Lawyers Guild and the Prison Justice
    League, which advocates for better conditions in Texas prisons.\n\nvia [Texas
    Sheriff’s Office Recorded Inmates’ Calls With Attorneys, Lawsuit Alleges](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/29/travis-county-sheriff-records-inmates-phone-calls_n_5235157.html).\n\nThe
    travesty of listening in to inmate calls is widely lost on those who have not
    been in jail. This gives the police a powerful home-field advantage. They know
    you’re freaked out. They know you’ll call home and they know you’ll say too much,
    because well, you will. It’s proven time and time again. So they listen in. Recorded
    calls are a monumental source of information for pending criminal charges or in
    defense of appeals.\n\nBecause of the safety of the institution inmates can’t
    do anything about any of that. Guards listen to calls because they can, but also
    because they have to listen to protect against looming crime.\n\nThe one buffer
    the courts give the incarcerated is legal calls and letters, which are privileged
    communication. Inmate calls to lawyers are critical, and both have to trust that
    they can communicate about the case. Yet ask a criminal defense attorney. Ask
    an inmate. They know. It’s a foolish trust, just as the above lawsuit lays out.\n\nJust
    a couple of weeks ago I had a conversation about this very topic with death row
    inmate Reggie Clemons who is waging the legal battle of his life in the highest
    courts of Missouri right now.\n\nThe potential impact of Department of Corrections
    officials listening to his legal calls could cost him his life. Clemons awaits
    a ruling by the state Supreme Court that could give him a retrial following a
    special justice’s determination that his conviction was buffered by shoddy police
    work, suppressed evidence and police coercion.\n\n“It’s heinous that they do this
    first off,” he said. “What makes it even more so is that I’m a death row inmate
    and they’ve been listening to my legal calls. Now I finally got a shred of undeniable
    proof that its actually taking place.”\n\nClemons said guards retaliating against
    him for complaints he made to his attorney, supposedly privileged communication.\n\n“They
    put me in the hole for 23 days,” he said.\n\nDespite so much legally riding on
    his various cases, Clemons has began the process of trying this phone case himself.
    It’s too important, he said, to himself and every inmate to ignore.\n\n“If the
    NSA can’t do data mining, why should DOC be able to do data mining of death row
    inmates legal calls?”\n\nClemons hopes to get legal help on this case because
    of its importance and precedence. His current attorney is focused on his death
    sentence. But he needs more legal help to stop corrections officials from breaking
    their own laws.\n\n“I try to articulate how bad things have gotten,” he said.
    “I’m trying to get people to galvanize and address the heinous things that are
    going on in here.”\n\nHopefully he will succeed. Any attorney who would like to
    consider this important case, please reach out. Some causes are worth it simply
    because they are right."

  title: ACLU to pump $50 million toward sentencing reform
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "More proof that the long awaited Tipping Point is not only
    upon us, but significant momentum to serious sentencing reform is underway:\n>
    With a $50 million foundation grant, the largest in its history, the American
    Civil Liberties Union plans to mount an eight-year political campaign across the
    country to make a change of criminal justice policies a key issue in local, state
    and national elections.\n> \n> The goal of the campaign, financed by George Soros’s
    Open Society Foundations, is to slash an incarceration rate that has tripled since
    1980. There are currently some 2.2 million prisoners in the United States.\n>
    \n> The campaign aims to translate into state and federal policy a growing belief
    among many scholars, as well as of a coalition of liberal, conservative and libertarian
    political leaders, that the tough-on-crime policies of recent decades have become
    costly and counterproductive.\n\nvia [A.C.L.U. in $50 Million Push to Reduce Jail
    Sentences – NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/us/aclu-in-dollar50-million-push-to-reduce-jail-sentences.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&_r=0).\n\nIt’s
    thrilling to see substantive money behind toppling this long-ignored billion dollar
    boondoggle. With the power of a genuine leader like George Soros behind this effort,
    it will make significant headway. Ironically, sentencing reform is one issue that
    Soros and the polar opposite Koch Brothers agree on, according to [the Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/09/here-s-a-reform-even-the-koch-brothers-and-george-soros-can-agree-on.html).
    That’s saying something about the size of problem.\n\nBut the question remains:
    When do the various levels of correction and criminal justice begin to reallocate
    its $50 billion a year budgets toward reform and rehabilitation instead of mass
    incarceration?\n\nInside Innovations could impact a prison and dozens of lives
    right now for a mere $50,000 and yet those in positions to say yes, continue to
    say there is no money. We say we’ll raise the money and it’s still not something
    they have time to do. Yet all it takes is a small donor and someone to open the
    doors to let us in, just like prisons do each week for AA volunteers, yoga teachers
    and religious organizations.\n\nThe issue to is turn the power of no into the
    possibility of yes. With a system this flawed — that has not moved the needled
    of the recidivism rate in thirty years despite billions spent each year — you’d
    think anything would be worth a try.\n\nIt may not take $50 million to bring about
    genuine reform. It certainly doesn’t take $50 billion. As the Native Americans
    say, “we need to dream all this again.”"

  contentAboveNewsletter: "Criminal U contributing writer Stephanie Allen-Gobert came
    to us as most everyone associated with our prison reform effort does: her life
    had been shredded within the maw of the industrialized criminal justice system
    following the arrest and staggering 20-year sentence of her husband Kevin Gobert.\n\nThe
    sentence came years after the arrest. Like many first-time offenders, Koos Gobert
    (as he is known) woke up. The seriousness of the crime helped him see the slide
    he had made into petty drug dealing.  A forty-something father and family man,
    Gobert lost his way with the lure of money.  During the long wait the federal
    courts put defendants through he rebuilt his life and his marriage to Stephanie.
    He did his best to change and work for a good deal. He had strong character references
    at sentencing, including detectives who investigated him.\n\nIt was all for nothing.
    Gobert was given twenty years for a non-violent drug charge.\n\nStephanie was
    devastated but determined. She started writing about FAMM and the effort to reduce
    drug sentencing. The Drugs Minus Two bill passed and is retroactive. Her husband
    should benefit. But the harsh sentence remains a cloud on their future. They are
    determined to get post-conviction relief and have the sentence reviewed in light
    of recent changes to sentencing guidelines and to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder’s
    directive to reduce the years given to drug offenders.\n\nSentencing reform has
    become palatable finally, after decades of political fears of being labeled soft
    on crime. Ridiculous sentences, billions of tax payer dollars being wasted annually
    and a realization that reform can truly happen have shifted the will in America
    to change its ways. Soon, perhaps, with much work to be done, America will lose
    its title as the leading country in the world when it comes to incarcerating its
    own citizens.\n\nI’ve written Koos in prison. He knows the obstacles he faces.
    But he’s a man who is leaning on his childhood faith, the strength of his family,
    and the love of his determined wife Stephanie. We’ve agreed to lock arms with
    them and help however we can.\n\nStephanie needs our help. In order to raise legal
    funds, Stephanie designed her own T-shirt. She’s selling them and accepting donations
    to defend her husband and reduce his sentence.  Share this story with others and
    ask them to lend a few bucks to a good family in need of the love and support
    a simple T-shirt purchase can bring. If you see me out and about, I’ll be rockin
    one of these.  I want it known that Koos is one guy who still has much to give.
    I’m joining Stephanie’s faithful belief her husband will be home, as she says,
    “and God knows it ain’t gonna be no twenty years.”\n\nAmen. Preach.\n\n[Click

  title: Children of inmates a high risk to follow
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I had spent more than 1,500 days inside when the call came for me to report to a conference room by the superintendent’s office. I was down to my last eight hours, nervously awaiting my 12:01 a.m. release.

    This meeting wasn’t on my to-do list. Weeks before I had been asked by a friend of a friend on behalf of a captain in a nearby police force. His work centered on [children of inmates](http://www.oregon.gov/DOC/TRANS/PROGMS/pages/oam_children.aspx). When his sister asked me if they could interview me I had no choice. I had agreed to do whatever I could to help, even it meant all the things I avoided while in prison, like talking to cops or even just putting myself out in the public eye. I reluctantly agreed.

    But now, with just a few hours left, I wanted to be anywhere else.

    I had promised. I intended to start my freedom right, by keeping my word and focusing on service, even uncomfortable service. I went.

    They interviewed me for over an hour. I spoke about things I was ready to put behind me — things like my crimes, the impact it had on my family and the hardship my choices brought to my kids.

    It wasn’t stuff I wanted to think about, much less on the day of my release.

    But soon I realized it was a gift from God, the perfect thing to be mindful as I re-entered the world.

    As Steve Christian wrote in a report for the [National Conference of State Legislatures](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/children-of-incarcerated-parents.aspx) in 2009, “Whatever one’s views about the appropriate role of incarceration in the criminal justice system, it is clear that imprisonment disrupts positive, nurturing relationships between many parents—particularly mothers—and their children. In addition, many families with children suffer economic strain and instability when a parent is imprisoned.”

    Children of inmates are incredibly high risk of ending up in prison themselves. With the epidemic rise of incarceration in America, a staggering number of kids have parents inside.

    And what’s been done to date is using a sheet of Bounty to staunch a shotgun blast wound. But thank God for the sheet of Bounty, because its a start.

    The captain and I had pretty nice little debate during the break to switch tapes. He argued that statistics said its cheaper to simply incarcerate adults and that catching the kids was the only way to reduce crime.

    I disagreed. But we heard each other respectfully. We later exchanged emails. I told him not to hesitate to call if I could be of service to the effort to keep children of inmates out of Criminal U.

    Later they interviewed my oldest daughter about her experiences.

    We both ended up in a video they use to promote the mission of helping children of incarcerated adults.

    One of my yoga teachers while I was still inside was a former counselor for incarcerated children. She was relentlessly positive and continued to remind us to think about “who you want to re-introduce to the world when you walk out those gates.”

    It stayed with me, especially that final afternoon when I gave an interview about the havoc my life and had wrought. It has stayed with me since, reminding me every day of the simple agenda: Do the right thing. And then do the next right thing.

    The timing wasn’t the best, but that’s how service works usually. It set the tone for my release. I’m glad I went. I’m especially glad people like that captain are putting the time  and energy to help those who truly need it the most — the very people we inmates far too often fail.

  title: 31 flavors of positive thought arming offers redemption story
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Remember back in the day just how incredibly excessive
    the very idea of 31 different ice cream flavors under one delightful counter felt?
    Long before Ben & Jerry’s took ice cream and ice-cream flavors to a whole new
    level, Baskin and Robbins would set the minds of kids like me into a decadent
    blur with the sheer panoply of choice. It was euphoric.\n\nSo with that in mind
    I crafted my own 31 flavors of positive thought arming a long time ago. Each one
    is a pearl on a necklace of excessive, decadent, euphoric positivity for me. If
    I’m going to face the utter intensity of this life and so well, I need to stay
    positive and arm my mind with relentless thoughts of possibility that each in
    their own way say, “this life is well worth living.”\n\nI crafted my personal
    positive thought arming arsenal back in prison, while in rehab, battling a 20-year
    dance with booze that was killing me and had already robbed me of my moral compass.
    In a long, long time of darkness these were the darkest days. By putting them
    together, committing them to memory and saying them in bits and pieces throughout
    the day, they saturated my brain with energy and resolve. These thoughts slipped
    together in a row, one after the other, each speaking directly to my soul and
    my mind that hope will truly never die.\n\n1) Love (It all starts with love):
    And they lived happily ever after — Aesop. (My wife and I said this all the way
    through, believing our fairy tale could survive. It did and still does and that’s
    why it’s first on the list).\n\n2) Honesty: God reveal to my own eyes… let me
    examine myself again, more closely — Augustine. The idea of repentance and self-examination,
    once something I drank to avoid, became a positive reminder for me as I journeyed
    back to health. It still is, part of my daily routine with the 11th step of Alcoholics
    Anonymous encouraging me to conduct a Daily Moral Inventory to continue the work
    of transformation.\n\n3) Resilience: Choose to survive well — Gandhi. We can’t
    often choose much, especially in places like prison or rehab (or in my case both
    at the same time!). But we can choose to survive well. I must have said this 1,500
    times, at least once a day for every day I spent in Criminal U.\n\n4) Acceptance:
    Shogani. A Japanese word used after the devastating Tsunami that I understand
    to mean: a calm determination to overcome that what cannot be controlled.\n\n5)
    Humility: It’s amazing what can be accomplished if we don’t care who gets the
    credit — President Ronald Reagan. Instead of worrying about me I began to focus
    on what can be accomplished a very positive lens from which to view even the toughest
    circumstance.\n\n6) Discipline: Just do it — Nike. I probably still say this five
    times a day and usually see a positive outcome.\n\n7) Excellence: We are what
    we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit –Aristotle. From
    humility and discipline comes a renewed hope and focus toward excellence.\n\n8)
    Determination: It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you don’t stop
    — Confucius Another of my go-to weapons whenever I get discouraged with the long
    road ahead.\n\n9) Grace: By God’s tender mercies, the morning light of heaven
    is about to break upon us and… lead us to the path of peace — Zechariah, father
    of John the Baptist.  This was one of those times when God seemed to speak directly
    to me, urging me on and assuring me not to lose hope.\n\n10) Peace: Be at peace
    as much as it depends on you. — St. Paul\n\n11) Faith: Be anxious for nothing
    but instead pray about everything — St. Paul. Peace and faith often go hand in
    hand. Both shape my focus toward a positive outcome even in the darkest times.\n\n12)
    Hope: For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. Plans to prosper you
    and not to harm you; plans to give you hope and a future — Jeremiah the prophet.
    Who doesn’t feel more positive reading this?\n\n13) Integrity: Do the right thing.
    And then do the next right thing. And so on. This cliché is used often in rehab,
    but like “Just do it” this has amazingly simple power to rebuild your moral compass
    — the first thing to go when sliding into alcoholism — one right act after another.\n\n14)
    Excellence: Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre
    minds — Albert Einstein.  To remind me to dream and not be discouraged by those
    that don’t.\n\n15) Patience: Man is the strangest of all animals. He is the only
    one to run faster after he has lost his way — Rollo May. A reminder to “slow my
    roll” and trust the long process of success.\n\n16) Service: True service cannot
    be taken advantage of — Dale Murphy. \n\n17) Integrity: Just say no — Nancy Reagan.
    It helps. A lot. Repeat it again. Go back to #13 and repeat it again. Stay the
    course.\n\n18) Discipline: Learn to define life backwards and live it forward
    — Soren Kierkegaard\n\n19) Acceptance: Life is difficult. This is a great truth,
    one of the greatest truths. Once we truly know that life is difficult than it
    ceases to be so — M. Scott Peck. (Yes, Peck needed an editor so I trimmed this
    up for him). Acceptance is one of the most positive things I can do.\n\n20) Kindness:
    Be kind — Lori Bolsinger.  She’s the kindest person I know. The more I’m with
    her, the more I see it in myself.\n\n21) Interdependence: “There are two questions
    a man must ask himself: The first is ‘Where am I going?’ and the second is ‘Who
    will go with me?’ — Sam Keen. This seems like a strange one for a positive thought
    arming but I read Fire in the Belly as a young man and it shaped my thinking more
    than just about any books I’ve read short of the Bible. Reminding myself this
    helps keep from life’s Drama, with a capital D, that so often derails me from
    my truest sense of self.\n\n22) Discipline: You can be brilliant and you can be
    stupid. Most of us are only stupid. Just become more brilliant and less stupid
    — Wayne Trussell. A true friend in his first letter to me in rehab. Few things
    mean as much to me.\n\n23) Discipline: It’s supposed to be hard. If it was easy
    anyone could do it. It’s the hard that makes it great — Jimmy Dugan. Those who
    know me, know I’m a big fan of the Tom Hanks character in A League of Their Own.
    This line sticks out from many.\n\n24) Discipline: No discipline is enjoyable
    while it is happening. It is painful. But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest
    of right living — St. Paul. See a theme here? That’s how transformation takes
    place. Through the mud comes a renewed sense of hope and even self. But it takes
    miles and miles of discipline, something I didn’t have before, to see it through.\n\n25)
    Kindness: Follow the platinum rule: treat others how they want to be treated.
    Another saying I picked up in rehab. It’s beautiful. It removes self from the
    equation, as kindness truly should be. Nothing fuels the tank like kindness and
    selflessness.\n\n26) Empathy: A good listener is more rare than an adequate lover
    — John MacDonald. The closer I neared renewal the less I thought about me. My
    ears opened.\n\n27) Faith: The worst has already happened and been repaired… All
    shall be well, all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well — Julian
    of Norwich.\n\n28) Freedom: To be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains,
    but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others — Nelson
    Mandela. These are like glasses that I put on now to view life and everything
    in it.\n\n29) Gratefulness: When I reflect on my family and friends, I am lifted
    up in celebration — Maya Angelou\n\n30) Acceptance: Choose the hill you want to
    die on.  Just one of those reminders that so much of what we think is worth it,
    truly isn’t. I’m not sure where I heard this, but it stuck.\n\n31) Love: God is
    constantly coloring outside the lines. Jesus challenges the structures that oppose
    and exclude. God busts through our traditions that put limitations on love. Love
    cannot be harnessed — Common Prayer for Ordinary Radicals. \n\nAnd my positive
    thought arming begins where it ends, with love. Because as St. Paul said, “the
    greatest of these is love.”\n\nBe positive. Be armed. Be well."

  title: Syracuse schools the ‘Mississippi’ of zero-tolerance fight
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The public language is often couched. For those not paying close attention, the true conflict during the recent school board meetings of the Syracuse, N.Y. public schools, can be overlooked. The fight seems localized, with little significance to those who do not call Syracuse home and whose children do not attend those schools.

    Through all the noise, conflict, debate and furor, what can be missed is Syracuse is rapidly becoming Ground Zero for a looming national fight over discipline in public schools. The zero-tolerance fight will be critical to the effort to break the school-to-prison pipeline that has funneled a river of young people into a lifetime enrollment at Criminal U.

    But as the clash rages over the leadership of Syracuse Schools Superintendent Sharon Contreras following a vote of no-confidence by the teachers union in June and now an announcement from the attorney general in support of the district’s disciplinary policies in favor of existing zero-tolerance polices.

    “Syracuse is the Mississippi of today. We should all be outraged. We want accountability,” says Walt Dixie, director of the local chapter of Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network.

    Beneath the issue of leadership bubbles a bitter fight along demographics, socioeconomic status and especially race, according to many of those embroiled in this summer’s fight for leadership and direction of the city’s school system.

    Here is a quick primer:
    Teachers are upset by changes in discipline instilled by Contreras. The teachers stormed a June school board meeting to issue a vote of no confidence before storming back out. Note the photo of the teachers above (eds note: *this was taken early and not at the actual meeting, nor was it intended to imply that it was taken at the actual meeting. Seventy-five percent of the teachers don’t live in the city, according to published reports*).

    See a common theme?

    “These teachers are major offenders who sustain the school to prison pipeline system with pride. They are members of the STA, with the right ‘leader’ in place to accomplish their task as a community, a community they do not reside in as residents and a community they would not invite to their personal dinner tables,” Chang said.

    This disparity became even more clear once the teachers left to conduct press conferences. The school board meeting continued.

    Dixie and other local advocates who are challenging so-called “zero-tolerance policies” in the district that they say have fueled the school-to-prison pipeline for decades.

    “The teachers had their people and their say and then they walked out of the meeting,” Dixie said. “But people of color were there saying, ‘let’s find a solution.’ It backfired on them. The good thing is the clergy, the business community, the other leaders have stood with the superintendent because she’s doing the right thing changing the culture.”

    Last week Contreras, the embattled superintendent in Syracuse who has tried to promote restorative justice discipline policies within the schools to reduce expulsions, received support from the school board.

    The board voted to give Contreras and board President Michelle Mignano the authority to complete an agreement with the state Attorney General’s office to amend discipline policies in accordance with a preliminary documents the AG’s office issued on June 10. The new policies will reduce student suspensions, lower the disproportionate rate of discipline of minorities and revise its code of conduct to ensure students’ due process rights are protected, according to published reports.

    “The board appears to be in support of the superintendent,” Chang says. “The community continues to urge the board to ensure that they are prepared to deal with the issues outlined by the AG’s report and to provide the superintendent with the necessary support that she needs to continue to work towards the improvement of the city school district.”

    The Attorney General initiated a review of the school’s policies last year following complaints from the local community and parents.

    Attorney General Eric Schneiderman released a statement last week decrying “zero-tolerance” discipline policies and applauding the board “for taking steps that will help eliminate the school-to-prison pipeline and expand the pathway to opportunity.”

    But Syracuse Teachers’ Association President Kevin Ahern said Contreras had failed to ensure a safe teaching and learning environment in schools, that working conditions have deteriorated under her leadership and that she has failed to provide leadership needed to address problems in the schools.

    Chang and other supporters say the attack on Contreras is less about her leadership and more about racial divides.

    “The matter remains about race, remains about civil injustices, low expectations of black and brown children, and the need to control the school district within their power as the majority,” Chang said. “But they are not the majority.”

    Dixie agrees with Chang, saying, “The teachers live in the burbs. They are not even registered voters in the city. This is a battle over kids and teachers, but also a battle of black and white. We are the voice of our kids, not you, thank you very much.”

    Ahern told local reporters that the only issue that matters is the lack of support Contreras has from the teachers she leads.

    “I have gone out of my way to avoid ending up where we ended up…” Ahern told local reporters after the vote of no-confidence. “And my members will tell you that, because I’ve been yelled at in every building in this district because of the actions of this superintendent.”

    But a wide range of other leaders and groups came out in support of Contreras, including William Pollard, the former dean of Syracuse University’s School of Social Work.

    “It is too easy to blame parents, it is too easy to blame other institutions in our community,” he said. “It is far more difficult for us to recognize the need to address the racial disparities, to address income disparities which create many of the difficulties that we face in our school system and in our city.”

    LaVonda N. Reed, a professor of law at the Syracuse University College of Law, a former board member of the Syracuse City School District Educational Foundation and Syracuse resident issued a commentary in support of Contreras.

    “Contreras has avoided being pulled by the STA into an us-against-them stance against the district’s students. She is courageous. More courageous than most of us because she is attempting to change things in a town that just doesn’t do change very well,” she wrote.

    Amid the high-profile battle, Contreras and Ahern continue negotiations to bring the rift to a resolution. The pair for a couple of hours in late June and, according to published reports, continue to work toward a resolution.

    Why the rest of the country may ignore the Syracuse debate from afar, or simply eye it with wary indifference, the push for a new paradigm that values students and attempts to keep them in school rather than expel them under zero-tolerance policies continues to gain ground across the country.

    If Syracuse is indeed Mississippi for the school-to-prison pipeline battle, then rest assured the battle will soon be waged at a school near you.

  title: Suit over strip search could dissolve ‘safety’ smokescreen
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Abusive tactics and a carnival strip search conducted by
    arresting police officers are under scrutiny and will remain so thanks to a courageous
    lawsuit filed in the Bay Area in October.\n\n> Four women arrested in a police-brutality
    protest have filed a federal lawsuit against the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office,
    saying they were forced to disrobe in front of men after being taken to jail.\n>
    \n> The plaintiffs, including attorney Anne Weills, the wife of Oakland mayoral
    candidate Dan Siegel, said deputies at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin had ordered them
    to remove their shirts and that they had been “paraded in front of male deputies
    and male prisoners.”\n> \nvia [Four women sue Alameda County sheriff over jail
    stripping – SFGate](http://m.sfgate.com/default/article/Four-women-sue-Alameda-County-sheriff-over-jail-5852830.php).\n\nIs
    anyone surprised that this happened to activists protesting police brutality?
    Call the irony police… no wait, never mind. Just in case, let’s leave the police
    out of it.\n\nEvery strip search is intended to degrade and assert ultimate power
    far more than it’s necessary for the so-called safety and security of the institution.
    Studies have shown and criminal justice experts agree that strip searches are
    largely ineffective. But they are still routine.\n\nSo is anyone surprised that
    police officers, who as a matter of daily routine use the power of the strip search
    to humiliate others, blow so past the boundaries of decency that parading a 70-year-old
    woman around naked is allowed?\n\nThis stuff happens often. What doesn’t happen
    often is it happening to victims who are activists, who know better and have the
    means to file suit against the offenders. We can only hope now the activists will
    refuse offers to settle quietly out of court and drag this through a newsworthy
    period of discovery, deposition and trial so that the culture of intimidation
    within this jail can be exposed. Because if its happening here in Oakland, it’s
    happening across the country as well.\n\nIf this case remains in the news, expect
    to soon hear the tell-tale “isolated incident” defense from sheriff’s officials.
    With so many isolated incidents, how can any abuse by police be considered “isolated?”
    Regardless, virtually every time a police officer abuses his or her power we soon
    hear its an isolated incident. We virtually never hear about the systemic and
    institutionalized beliefs that lead to the abuse of power. We virtually never
    hear from police officers who are absolutely sick of those in their ranks who
    tarnish the important work they do.  Until the many who serve nobly and with honor
    insist on reform from behind the shield the effort will be compromised and these
    “isolated incidents” will continue.\n\nIsolated incident? Tell that to a California
    adjunct professor Dr. Jean Kennedy who visited Smyrna, Ga. was arrested and had
    her hair forcibly chopped during her brief stay.\n\nYou don’t have to look hard
    to find how these experiences are anything but isolated.\n\nMost importantly we
    never hear about the culture of degradation that exists within police departments
    and jails and prisons across the country, which is a direct result of the lack
    of focus on rehabilitation and the systemic dehumanization that has become common
    place.\n\nA first step toward reform could be removing the smokescreen of so-called
    safety and security measures like strip searches. Wherever the term is employed
    let scrutiny and evaluation be enhanced not silenced as is the current norm.\n\nThen
    we will see what really happens behind closed bars."

  title: 'Rule #10: Speak your truth, with love'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    As I look back on my life, virtually every scene that makes me cringe starts with a lie. Perhaps every scene. Every red-faced moment. Every gut-wrenching failure. Every time I wish I could beg for a Mulligan: Deceit resides there.

    I’m sure everyone has memories that still make them wince to think about? I have more than I wish. They become indelible, seared somehow on our souls. We recall them and feel the embarrassment or disapproval again as if the event was happening in that present moment all over again. The memory evokes the emotional response. That’s how stinkin’ important the truth is.

    I recall one moment, all the way back when I was in first grade. I was the star in the Easter play. My first real crush, a blonde beauty named Jodie, was my co-star. I was in love! For several days leading up to the play she missed school due to an illness. Oh, how I missed her. Then the opportunity arose, a wonderful opportunity to be her knight in shining armor. The teacher asked if any of us lived by her. I shot my hand up. I agreed to drop off her homework. I was thrilled!

    Until…

    It dawned on me I had no idea where she lived. Well, I had a sort of idea. She had once told me where she lived. But I was so pie-eyed I barely listened. After school, vital papers in hand, I furiously tried to recall what she said as I informed my father of my top-level important, mission we needed to accomplish on the drive home.

    “Turn here…Yeah..This is it.” I said, my father’s huge head looking down on me like I was an alien. “Uh…left here…I….think…”

    “You think? I thought you knew where this girl lived?”

    “I do!” I demanded.

    I even went so far as to get out of the car, walk up to a random door, knock, and sheepishly ask for Jodie.

    “Uh, there’s nobody named Jodie here,” the lady said kindly.

    Soon we were headed home, her homework undelivered in my lap.

    “Just tell the teacher you couldn’t find her house,” my dad said, shrugging it off, while my abject failure burned inside of me.

    I should have known right then the magical power a beautiful girl could have over me and the trouble that would cause me in the years to come. Especially the next morning when my teacher asked me if Jodie got her homework.

    “Yep, I dropped it off.” I lied.

    I think back and want to smack that little dude. Idiot! I think now, and I thought then. The next two days I lived in mortal fear for the day Jodie returned and my failure would be tossed into the open for all to see. Jodie would know I was a liar. All would be lost!

    The torment I put myself through was worse than the actual day of reckoning. Jodie was far behind on the school work, but the teacher believed some type of honest mistake had been made. Jodie still looked at me that way, unaware of my role in pushing her father behind. The play was a huge hit! I was a star! But my shame, my lie remains. And so I still remember it to this day.

    Fast forward to my junior year in high school. I clashed with a favorite teacher, who put me in my place, embarrassing me in front of my class. I mumbled under my breath.

    “You’re such an asshole,” I said.

    Yep, he heard me.

    “What did you call me?” he thundered.

    Our clash now reached a new level. I knew it. I’d crossed the line and with one of the few teachers I respected and desperately wanted to respect me. I could have said, “I called you an asshole because you’re being one right now!” It would have been honest. I’d then take my lumps like a man. I’d have forgotten the episode by now as he likely has. But I didn’t.

    I could have said, “I called you an asshole and regretted it as soon as it crossed my lips. I’m sorry.”

    It would have been most honest. It would have been mature. I might now still recall the episode but with a sense of inner growth. Instead, I didn’t.  I lied. I made up a stupid statement that I said something else to someone else. My lie scrawled across my blushed face as if written with a fat Sharpie. Nobody, I mean nobody, believed me. The teacher’s eyes burned my skin as surely as if he put a cigarette out upon my chest. I still feel the embarrassment. I cringe at my weakness.

    And so it goes. Choice after choice missed to simply tell the truth, to extinguish the fuse, to salvage a bad situation. Jesus knew exactly what he was saying when he said, “The truth shall set you free.”

    It’s so easy really. On one hand, a lie. Hard to conjure up, harder to remember, nearly impossible to forget unless you dull your conscience and darken your soul. On the other hand, truth. Lay it out there. A great cliché: let the chips fall where they may. It is what it is. In my experience, that approach costs far less in the long-term than the lie ever does.

    But here’s the snag: An exhaustive study years ago in a book The Day America Told the Truth, discovered that 90 percent of Americans lie regularly. Ninety percent. Now that’s bondage. No wonder the truth can set you free.

    But rule #10 isn’t just speak the truth, but it adds two vital words: Speak your truth, in love.

    Why those two words? To be blunt, it’s the exact opposite of being “painfully honest,” which is popular these days. Have you noticed how many people talk about being painfully honest? And yet it seems a situational approach directed at someone. A far different approach comes when directed at oneself.

    From my experience those being “painfully honest” are usually inflicting the pain on someone else, which is not the point of truthfulness.  Just because you know the truth, is it loving to offer it? Often we aren’t even asked when we rush to be “painfully honest” about someone else or about something that doesn’t even concern us. That’s not the truth, its gossip. And it’s insidious. “No comment,” is an effective, powerful form of the truth. Often it is the only loving response. At other times, the truth, spoken candidly and plainly is the most loving action available. Only with practice, with a sincere commitment to not be one of the 90 percent of liars in America can the correct response be discovered.

    Now I know it seems I’m taking something pretty straightforward like “don’t lie,” and making it all kinds of complicated, but I suspect it’s necessary. If 90 percent of us do lie, then clearly the whole truthfulness lesson isn’t sinking in. It doesn’t take a scientist to look around at our world and see rivers of bullshit flooding over the banks of our lives. Daily reports of the very people who present themselves as our moral, political and economic leaders inundate us with their deceit. Our so-called heroes are often far more focused on their brand than their morality. Reality shows can’t be further from reality.

    So let’s take one final pause and dwell for a moment on this very important rule #10. Notice I did not say, speak The truth.. I said speak your truth. This lesson not only calls for the discretion of speaking truthfully when appropriate, but it calls for discernment and humility to understand we alone are not arbiters of truth. We don’t hold the crystal ball. Rarely is truth absolute. Rarely is our experience the only experience or our understanding the only way to understand a situation. If we recognize our truth is simply what we best understand the truth to be, we leave plenty of room for the experiences of others. We become welcoming rather off-putting, humble rather than haughty.

    I learned too late to use a vital weapon that can slay the devil of deceit within me. Let’s call it a holy pause. My parents used to say “think before you speak.” Give yourself a holy pause to consider your response. Far too often the first thought, the almost instinctual response is a lie. Amazing really. Lies just pour out of us if we let them. They are like weeds. Turn your back on them and they desecrate your landscape, woven into plants, creeping into the lawn, even so powerful as to push up through concrete! Yank them out and they break off, leaving roots to sprout deceit again. Till them asunder and they spread their seeds even deeper into the soil. The way to control weeds is to never let them grow. To pluck them out, one by one, from their roots the moment they sprout. The Holy pause, that moment to think before we speak is just the time. To stop the weeds from taking hold.

    Obviously I could go on. Whole courses of philosophy are dedicated to the nature of truth. Debates have ranged for centuries as to whether there is an appropriate time to lie. We have spent lifetimes debating the extreme margins of truth in search of where it breaks down. But fortunately those extreme moments when a lie might be the best course are just that: extremely rare. And that’s not the problem for 90 percent of Americans. The basic, clear cut, day-to-day battle to be a truthful person has proved telling the truth is pretty straight forward and pretty difficult.

    In the end if you remember one thing, remember this: It’s true when they say all a man has at times is his word. Guard yours well. The times you don’t will surely hang around to remind you, as uncomfortable as it may be.

  title: Justices must step in after botched Oklahoma execution
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "This is the United States of America. It isn’t the land
    of Oz. Yet prison officials continue to try to keep citizens from peering behind
    the curtain at a broken system so flawed that it impacts every level with cries
    of incompetence, injustice and corruption.\n\nOn April 29 a reporter saw officials
    do what they do so often every day. He watched as a man struggling and in pain
    lay dying but not dead in a botched execution as prison officials closed the blinds
    so nobody could see what came next. Too late Oz, your secret is secret no longer.\n\nWhat
    came next was pandemonium. Then a halt to the execution. Then the man died anyway,
    from a heart attack as a result of the secret cocktails pumped into his system
    by the state of Oklahoma. At the start of a recent scheduled interview with death
    row inmate Reggie Clemons, the issue of the sad state of Oklahoma executions trumped
    all other issues at first.\n\nBefore I could get the first questions out of my
    mouth, Clemons wanted information about Oklahoma. He raised issues that now seem
    prescient. At that time Clemons was focused on the court rulings that an inmate
    didn’t have the right to know what drugs would be used to kill him. He predicted
    this would lead to all kinds of troubles. But not even Clemons could have predicted
    the type of trouble prison officials tried to literally pull a curtain to hide
    last night during its grossly flawed execution.\n\nThe botched Oklahoma execution
    — the second such disaster in as many months — must sound that alarm that society
    will insist on seeing the truth. The time for a federal stay of executions has
    come. The basic notion that we can kill in secret and kill with no idea of what
    cocktail of drugs is being used is so fundamentally opposed to our constitution
    that it can not be condoned another day. \n\nNPR reported that the execution was
    so flawed it was stopped. The inmate later died of a heart attack.\n\n> “According
    to reporters tweeting from inside the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester,
    Oklahoma, the execution of Clayton D. Lockett has failed. Lockett died of a heart
    attack after the execution was aborted.\n> \n> The execution of Charles Warner,
    which was supposed to take place at 9 p.m. ET., was stayed by Corrections Director
    Robert Patton.\n> \n> According to the AP reporter on the scene, about 34 minutes
    after the execution was scheduled to begin, Lockett was still conscious.\n\n“He
    was lifting [his] head at [7:39 p.m. ET] and he was still alive and DOC closed
    [the] curtain and stopped it,” [Cary Aspinwall tweets](https://twitter.com/caryaspinwall/status/461297136793948161).\n\nPatton
    told reporters that Lockett’s vein failed during the execution, preventing the
    chemicals from entering his body. All three drugs, however, were administered.\n\nAt
    8:06 p.m. ET., more than an hour after the execution was scheduled to begin, Lockett
    died of a massive heart attack.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the execution, there
    had been much controversy over the combination of drugs the state was going to
    use for the execution.”\n\nIn my interview with Clemons earlier this month he
    said the secrecy was a looming disaster.\n\n“The thing that is scary to me — and
    that’s one of the reasons there is a petition out there called ‘Capital Consequences’
    in memory of Rachel King. The petition is attempting to challenge the legality
    of the death penalty in its practice and implementation. And what this lethal
    injection really is.– is that in order to continue executing people they are hiding
    what’s involved and what the practices are. Imagine if other areas of government
    start to do that, like a police, where they don’t have to tell you what they do.
    It’s a dangerous precedent their trying to set.”\n\nClemens saw how Oklahoma’s
    determination to continue killings despite so many inhumane issues at hand and
    despite a lack of transparency that is fundamental to our constitution could set
    a terrible precedence down the road in states like Missouri, where Clemens still
    sits on death row despite a judge’s ruling that his confession was coerced and
    the police work to convict him was beyond “shoddy.”\n\nOrganizers in Oklahoma
    have planned protests and are starting efforts to have the entire broken death
    penalty killing machine ground to a halt. But the state is a determined killer,
    one of seven nationwide that executes about 90 percent of all the executions in
    the United States (2010-2014). Oklahoma is one of only seven states that actively
    use the death penalty and do so despite recent studies that show the [nearly five
    percent of all executed Americans are innocent](http://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethlopatto/2014/04/29/how-many-innocent-people-are-sentenced-to-death/).\n\nA
    pause — a good long, reasoned pause that rethinks the entire debate — is needed.
    Now. We’ve seen how flawed our criminal justice system with the wave of exonerations.
    We’ve seen the terrible police tactics in communities across the country. We’ve
    seen the numbers about innocents behind bars. And now we’ve seen a barbaric murder
    as a result of secret drug cocktails and hurried executions.\n\nIt has to stop.\n\nDo
    one thing today to help: Sign the petition to stop executions in the name of author
    and ALCU activist Rachel King by [clicking here](http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/justice-4-reggie-clemons/?source=search).
    And tell everyone you know to do the same. As a society of justice and democracy,
    we can do so much better than this."

  title: Conjugal visits are as extinct as dinosaurs
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    It’s a term most people know.

    In the glossary of prison terms, conjugal visits somehow evolved into one of the few things people outside know about what goes on inside Criminal U. They may not know that a jail and a prison are not the same thing nor that the idea of sending a care package of baked goods to an inmate is a relic, but they know that conjugal visits allow inmates to have sex with their significant others.

    What they don’t know is that this privilege of conjugal visits is all but extinct, now that Mississippi, the last state to even use the term, has ended a conjugal visit program that has been in effect for nearly 100 years.

    According to the New York Times, Christopher B. Epps, Mississippi’s prison commissioner, ended the program Feb. 1, “citing budgetary reasons and ‘the number of babies being born possibly as a result.’”

    Some states still offer extended overnight visits, as they are now called. But these are very few and far between. The vast majority have simply cut off this potential for human intimacy while incarcerated.

    Costs are always cited. It’s the trump card within the Department of Corrections. They can’t afford anything related to rehabilitation but they keep tossing more folks into prison.

    The average voting, tax-paying citizen in America would respond to this news with a simple evaluation: “Good.”

    They believe inmates have it too nice and that they shouldn’t be allowed to have sex while incarcerated. They want punishment, not rehabilitation. This is understandable. It’s the majority point of view. The tyranny of the masses. Group think. It’s why so many prisons have stopped the conjugal programs. It also flies in the face of rehabilitation.

    Like prison rape, conjugal visits are a familiar punch-line when it comes to prison talk, be it in Hollywood-perpetuated myths or popular misunderstanding of the societal toll of operating Criminal U. Neither are things to laugh about. Those who just lost conjugal visits aren’t laughing. Believe that.

    Family contact is among the most powerful factors in cutting recidivism rates. In country’s like Norway that put a primary focus on rehabilitation, human connections are central to the [cycle of incarceration](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people).

    Treating inmates like human beings remains a foreign concept in America’s prisons and likely is the main reason why we have utterly failed at lowering recidivism rates.

    This is a basic question that must be addressed. Can we punish without dehumanizing? Norway does with great success. But in America, as Mississippi’s change of its conjugal program exemplifies, we are still moving in the opposite direction.

    The jokes continue but so does the real cost. It may only get worse before it gets better. There’s nothing funny about that.

  title: 'Rule #25: Try to find a way to say yes'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Parenthood came easily to me despite being one at the age of 20. Something about that screaming ball of human goo shot right to my heart and commanded my attention. It’s a demand I’ve rarely tired of since.

    That is not to say I didn’t make a whole cruiser-liner full of mistakes. Of course I did– and then some. I needed anger management according to my son, remember? It’s just kids are very forgiving creatures, and I gave it a fair and loving effort most of the time. I think they respect the effort I give, while often registering their discontent with the methods. I look at our kids now and I see four people I enjoy more than most anyone else on the planet. So I did OK and did it happily. I’m in my forties and I still often wake up and think, “Maybe just one more. One final ball of screaming human goo would be really nice.” That’s how much I took to parenthood.

    I bring that up now because this rule grew directly from the parenting experience. Raising kids taught me to find a way to say yes.

    Kids are just impossible. They want everything from five candy bars for breakfast to the freedom to experiment with hot cooking oil while still learning to walk. Everything they want makes perfect sense to them and freaks parents completely out if it doesn’t just exhaust them first. Just to keep them alive you find yourself saying no dozens of times a day.

    But, if you don’t pay attention you can soon resemble the Republican Party saying “no” to virtually any idea that arises. That’s no way to live (despite what Republicans claim).

    A certain amount of “no” is inevitable; another measure of it is invaluable, and not just with your kids, but with co-workers, significant others, family, yourself. Psychologically this is called boundaries, and they’re essential for a healthy personality (Believe me, this is a new lesson for me. I had no idea what boundaries were back in my drinking days).

    But like a great yoga pose, this takes balance. Saying no all the time knocks you out of whack. We have to find a way to say yes enough to keep things in balance.

    Because it is so much easier to say “no,” it takes additional attention to say “yes.” Try to find a way to say yes. Be somebody who avoids the reflex “no” and considers ways to say “yes.”

    For one, you’ll enjoy the reaction more than you do saying “no,” (Unless you’re a Republican. They strangely seem to enjoy saying no immensely. Go figure?). You’ll also sense in yourself a growing spirit of cooperation. “Yes” is pleasant much of the time. The world needs more pleasant people.

    Let me say that again, just in case you missed it: Yes fuels a growing spirit of cooperation from within. It flows out and breeds pleasantness. The word needs more pleasantness.

    Right? It’s worth repeating… and repeating… and repeating until you develop the habit of trying to find a way to say yes.

    Trying to say “yes” also brings more consideration. It’s reflection over reaction, particularly when you are in the position of power. Power in any form has a tremendous potential to corrupt. Reflection, consideration, flexibility, creating all help keep that power in check. A reflexive No smacks of power, impulsively reminded those less powerful of their station in life. It breaths discontent. Soon even more power is needed to maintain control and to quash the potential of rebellion. No becomes the only option. No wonder Thomas Jefferson said a little rebellion against tyranny is a good thing now and again.

    If there is any environment in America these days that requires a little rebellion against tyranny — or maybe a whole shitload of rebellion– it’s the American prison system. Thirty years of rampant, excessive incarceration has given the criminal justice system virtually unfettered power. The lack of interest from those funding that buildup has allowed it to become tone deaf to the subtleties of human rehabilitation, which is the job. It’s right there in the title: Department of Corrections. Yet I’ve never experienced such a powerful culture tuned to the reflexive no. It’s a billion-dollar institution that has to overcome obstacle courses of no to simply find a yes. It’s no way to rehabilitate. It’s no way to innovate. Without innovation the criminal justice rehabilitation this country desperately needs will never occur.

    Culture change requires yes. Personal change requires yes. Freedom to evolve as human beings requires yes. We all need to find a way to say yes.

    Perhaps we impact the world whenever we say yes. We add a degree of heat to the cold state of status quo. Consider the state of the world each time you consider whether to grant a favor, or to make plans to visit, or to do something kind even if inconvenient, or to buy a candy for your child after saying no so many times before.

    Say “no” and the world will keep on spinning. You won’t morph into Dr. Evil. But you won’t release the power of yes either.

    Try to find a way to say yes. Sometimes you can’t, and you’ll say no with a peaceful heart. Sometimes you’ll say yes. And they will smile. You’ll smile. You’ll feel good.

    And there is nothing wrong with that.

    man, you crazy.”\n\nI wanted to make sure there were enough people so the class

    get active. I recruited. I was starved for a positive outlet, something to remind
    myself I still could do some good in this world. I wanted to knit.\n\nAs it turns
    out I didn’t have to recruit. The response — so quiet that I thought nobody was
    even signing up at all — of kytes asking to be put on the class filled it to capacity
    in days.\n\nI didn’t know this however. I kept waiting for news about the class.
    I forced Ghost and several others to sign up. I waited. Eventually I caught up
    to the prison staffer who had issued the memo seeking interest in the class. I
    asked her why it hadn’t started. She confirmed the response was overwhelming.
    The problem was, she said, she didn’t know anyone to teach us how to knit.\n\n“So
    you didn’t plan who would teach the class?” I asked, trying not to sound incredulous.\n\n“No,
    I thought we could learn by video, but that’s not going to work. And I still…
    well, I didn’t think it through, I guess. I didn’t really expect the interest.
    We’ll figure it out though,” she said with a wave as she walked away.\n\nI knew
    then it wasn’t going to happen. Most every positive thing that happens in prison
    happens for one reason: Someone volunteers. Without that, ideas die on the vine
    of wishful thinking.\n\nThankfully, one program in Maryland had a volunteer. Read
    about this one, and see just how big a difference people can make:\n> In late
    2009, Lynn Zwerling stood in front of 600 male prisoners at the Pre-Release Unit
    in Jessup, Maryland. “Who wants to knit?” she asked the burly crowd. They looked
    at her like she was crazy.\n> \n> Yet almost two years later, Zwerling and her
    associates have taught more than 100 prisoners to knit, while dozens more are
    on a waiting list to take her weekly class. “I have guys that have never missed
    one time in two years,” Zwerling says. “Some reported to us that they miss dinner
    to come to class.”\n> \n> Zwerling, 67, retired in 2005 after 18 years of selling
    cars in Columbia, Maryland. She didn’t know what to do with her time, so she followed
    her passion and started a knitting group in her town. No one came to the first
    meeting, but the group quickly grew to 500 members.\n\nvia [How Knitting Behind
    Bars Transformed Maryland Convicts | Business on GOOD](http://www.good.is/posts/prisoners-transform-through-knitting-behind-bars).\n\nI
    still don’t know how to knit. But I know this: every inmate that does is likely
    a bit further ahead on the road back to his or her own humanity. Small things
    that seem like nothing outside can make all the difference to those on the inside,
    who run the risk of losing themselves, becoming nothing more than the number on
    their clothes, every day."

  title: 'Profits prisons: ‘If we build it, they will come’'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    When America’s largest private prison company opened a 2,000-bed facility in a barren stretch of the Mojave Desert in southeastern California in 1997, there was no guarantee that any inmates would ever reside there.

    California’s exceptionally powerful prison guard union was waging a fierce campaign against private prison companies, telling voters that the facilities were poorly run and that the industry would take away union jobs. “Public safety should not be for profit,” Don Novey, president of the prison guard union, told the San Francisco Chronicle at the time.

    Still, David Myers, the president of Corrections Corporation of America, a Nashville-based giant of the for-profit prison industry, believed his company’s decision to build a prison in that remote corner of the state would eventually pay off.

    “If we build it, they will come,” he predicted.

    Sixteen years later, as California struggles to relieve overcrowding in one of the nation’s largest prison systems, the inmates are coming by the thousands.

    Last week, Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed a three-year deal to lease the CCA prison at $28.5 million per year. The prison is currently occupied by federal inmates and operates at well under full capacity, according to recent reports.

  title: The Tipping Point moves from back rooms to plain sight
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Two years ago I started writing about The Tipping Point.
    It’s a theme I refer back to often.\n\nIt started in my brain when I read a noted
    New York Times columnist document the absolutely bankrupt reality of the modern
    prison system in America. But he said candidly, “the political will” didn’t exist
    despite lawmakers from both parties recognizing the urgent need to fix the billion-dollar
    boondoggle that is Criminal U (that last part is my editorializing addition to
    the writer’s column).\n\nI covered politics for years. I knew the tipping point
    would come when the voters heard a new story. Politicians didn’t care because
    voters didn’t care. Tough on crime legislation worked because most people don’t
    know criminals. They vilify them, scandalize them, incarcerate them and forget
    about them. It worked.\n\nBut it didn’t. The system can’t sustain itself. The
    true costs have come home and they are staggering, impacting every facet of social
    life. So the political will is now needed to change the voters’ opinion and make
    them care. That is the Tipping Point.\n\nWe’re not there yet, but there no longer
    is any doubt in the direction we are moving. When Tea Party Golden Boy Rand Paul
    and Obama Administration Attorney General Eric Holder get together, it’s news.\n\nConsider
    this Odd Couple who has found common ground on the issue of prison reform:\n>
    Mr. (Rand) Paul, a Kentucky Republican, is one of the Obama administration’s most
    vocal critics. But their discussion focused on an issue on which they have found
    common cause: eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n>
    \n> The two men are unlikely allies. Their partnership unites the nation’s first
    African-American attorney general, who sees his legacy in a renewed focus on civil
    rights, and some of Congress’s most prominent libertarians, who have accused the
    Obama administration of trampling on personal freedom with drones, wiretaps, tracking
    devices and too much government.\n> \n> While a range of judges, prosecutors and
    public defenders have for years raised concerns about disparities in punishment,
    it is this alliance that may make politically possible the most significant liberalization
    of sentencing laws since President Richard M. Nixon declared war on drugs.\n\nvia
    [Holder and Republicans Unite to Soften Sentencing Laws – NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/us/politics/holder-and-republicans-unite-to-soften-sentencing-laws.html?hp&_r=0).\n\nThe
    war on drugs is over and lost. The era of mass incarceration has run its course.
    With more than seven million Americans on supervision, it is no longer true that
    people don’t know criminals.  And when we spend more to imprison an adult than
    we do to educate a child, something has to change.\n\nThat’s the Tipping Point,
    and it’s coming. Soon."

  title: 'Books: The one item you can still send to an inmate'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I sent a package to my friend Tony, an inmate at the notorious Attica prison. I was surprised I could still send a package with stuff from the outside. The old days of a bag of mom’s cookies coming to an inmate are long gone. Even the stuff I sent Tony had to be packaged and meet all sorts of restrictions.

    When I went to prison, nobody in my circle knew this. They all wanted to send me a package. I had to educate them. It really bummed me out.

    I did learn that books could be sent in. Again, not from an individual, but from something like Amazon. Soon, I had a library of gifts too large to keep on my bunk. I was constantly juggling my books, donating some, giving some away, sending some back home. I was blessed with books, which is still the one package that can most often be sent inside.

    The notion of how much inmates read is lost on people. The stereotypes are too prevalent. You say “inmate” and thoughts of gangbangers pushing rusty metal weights pops up. Sure that happens inside Criminal U. But even more often you see inmates, including those gangbangers, parked on a bunk, their nose in a book.

    I watched deputies in a jail once search a series of cells. They made a particularly destructive display of their search, tossing confiscated items over the rails so all those in the cells below could see them. Items crashed onto the hard concrete floors below in a heap that the orderlies would have to clean up later. We could hear the deputies having a great time trashing the cells. When I was marched back from yard to our unit I looked down to the cell floor below. A pile of donated books lay among the heap. Many pages once held precariously by contraband tape lay scattered within the mess. The ruined books looked like living things murdered for the entertainment of the guards.

    Everyone involved knew how much those books meant to the inmates, especially the guards that confiscated them. Why would the confiscate books they provided? Because the inmates had too many books in their cell. They destroyed them intentionally to send a point and to hit where they knew it would hurt.

    That’s how books are valued in prison.

    There are seven million Americans currently under some type of legal supervision. Most of these millions, and the millions more once a part of the system that have since moved on, picked up the habit of reading while incarcerated coupled with an intense interest in anything that connects to their experience.

    Stereotypes help create false impressions that inmates are illiterate and most assuredly wouldn’t buy books. This is patently false.

    During my time in jails, prisons and rehab I learned that news programs were the most popular of all television shows. Newspapers and news magazines were passed along until worn out entirely. Books were everywhere.

    The facts support my experience. The Bargain Books catalog does massive sales directly to prisoners. Amazon makes daily deliveries to every prison in the country. Dozens of advocacy groups operate across the country simply to put books into the hands of prisoners and into prison libraries. Books to Prison Inmate Book Project and similar organizations receive between 800 and 1,000 inmate requests for books each month, a total that exceeds more than a half million annual requests.

    This represents a significant opportunity for reform, which is exactly what the [Prison Book Program](http://www.prisonbookprogram.org/) is trying to seize. Here’s [a list of programs focused on books](http://www.prisonbookprogram.org/resources/other-books-to-prisoners-programs/) for inmates.

    This is just one more way you can make a difference.

  title: Adrian Thomas awaits fate in NY court, a second time
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The fate of Adrian Thomas will soon be decided in the courts. Thomas first lost in 2009 when charged with the murder of his infant son and sentenced to 25-years-to-life. By all accounts he’s paid dearly, losing the rest of his family as well. His ex-wife and step daughter both testified against him last week in court.

    But Thomas is back in court because regardless of the outcome of this trial, he was subjected to unconscionable interrogation tactics by police who cared little for forensics or fact. They saw a dead baby, saw a large father who by all accounts was a distracted father at best, and pegged him as their man. Nine hours of brow-beating, threats and emotional abuse later, Thomas confessed.

    “Throughout the course of the interrogation, they told Thomas 67 times that they were sure it was an accident, 14 times that he would not be arrested, and eight times that he would be going home if he simply confessed,” Criminal Justice reform advocate Hannah Riley wrote. “At one point in the interrogation, a detective told him, ‘You want to save your son’s life, man?  Why are you holding out on me?’”

    The drama of this confession was captured in an award-winning documentary *Scenes of a Crime* that is compelling viewing for those interested in knowing why innocent people would ever confess.

    The state court of appeals tossed out his confession and ordered a retrial.

    We have since learned that reputable doctors will testify for the defense that the boy tragically died of sepsis, not trauma. Still the prosecution continues to push for a conviction.

    Suddenly the best the prosecutor can come up with is a jailhouse cellie who says Thomas confessed to him. Never mind he’s written several such letters to the prosecutors ratting on several other cellies. This is the guy jurors are supposed to believe.

    There is ample evidence that jailhouse informants are terribly unreliable. If you’ve ever met one for yourself, you’d never allow one in court again. There is also ample evidence that many innocent people confess to crimes they didn’t commit, or at the very least did something far less than they are being accused of. But if you’ve never been caught in the gears of this massive industrial machine, you can’t really know what it’s like.  Scenes of a Crime gives you a glimpse of understanding.

    The trial is ongoing. Stay tuned for a verdict. Regardless of Thomas’ guilt or innocence, what has been made painfully clear is the police in this case are on trial right along with him.

    I am cynical about programs. I am especially cynical about government programs. I am equally cynical about church programs, well intended they may be. I have experience with all of the above and know how much time I spent talking about a problem, rather than actually solve a problem.

    But it is hard to be cynical when you see easily 200 people, leaders of churches and leaders of local government and activists whose hearts beat for the cause gather at 9 a.m. on a weekday for one and only one reason: to give homeless people homes. The gathering is the [San Francisco Interfaith Council](http://www.sfinterfaithcouncil.org/) and its taking seriously the charge by Mayor Ed Lee to end chronic homeless here in ten years.

    We face a significant obstacle within each of us, one I think just about any day I am out and about among the city’s homeless. A loss of hope. We don’t believe we can change the situation. We don’t believe we can give homes to everyone.

    “That’s the biggest enemy we have,” says Bevan Duffy, director of the mayor’s office of Housing Opportunity Partnerships & Engagement.

    As much as I grow weary with talk about this problem, I confess my own hubris. I have even fewer answers. But just 30 minutes into this conference and so much misinformation about homelessness has already been corrected. Like this:

    “The reality is we pay so much more to have people on the streets than we would pay to house these people,” Duffy said.

    Like this: “We can solve this, because we created it,” said Jennifer Freidenbach, executive director of the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness.

    Yes the problem is everyone in this room is the choir and the folks at the lectern are the preachers. We don’t know all of it, but just by being here we are likely to be more aware.

    But what about everyone else? What about you, dear reader, who might have stumbled on this today?

    We can solve this. I am surrounded by more than 200 who can testify.

    So let’s talk just a little while today. Let’s talk about the basic human dignity of a home and the need for a great society like ours to care for the weakest among us: the addicted, the mentally ill, the infirmed, the incarcerated and the homeless.

    How do you solve homelessness? House people.

    We can do this.

    an autobiographical show, which they performed at New York City Center – Stage

  title: Mentors make the difference defying recidivism
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    “The only mentors I had were heroin dealers,” Jose Vasquez, dean of admissions for Defy Ventures said.

    But that’s changed, just like virtually every part of his life. The former entrepreneurial drug dealer from Rhode Island is now mentored by a CEO of a major corporation. In turn Vasquez recruits ex-inmates to turn their natural entrepreneurial talents into businesses that pay taxes, create jobs and build communities rather than cost communities so dearly with the cycle of crime and recidivism that still ensnares a majority of those getting out.

    Monday night in Oakland a small group of determined folks gathered to hear a pitch about a Defy Ventures entrepreneurial education course for inmates now coming to the Bay Area.  As Vasquez said repeatedly, “this is not for everybody.”

    But it is an innovative, well-funded, aggressive approach to empowering those returning from prison who know the odds are stacked.

    This meeting in Oakland had its problems, but it [stemmed from an earlier success](http://postnewsgroup.com/blog/2014/08/07/formerly-incarcerated-men-women-look-transform-hustle/), according to a story in the Oakland Post. Vasquez admitted they are working out the kinks as they launch in Oakland a program that has already graduated more than 100 ex-cons in the New York.

    The program started late. The power point had its problems, not the least of which included typos. Most importantly, the “application process” didn’t work. Applicants were required to reply to questions to be approved to attend, but clearly those responses weren’t read by the staff. Appeals to dress in business attire and arrive at 5:45 PM sharp, while well intended, fell flat when anyone was admitted and the entire program didn’t start until 6:15 PM.

    In short, the so-called vetting process really didn’t vet anyone, but according to Vasquez, may have deterred interested people from the outset.

    Another problem isn’t that some tuition will be required of those applicants, but it wasn’t really explained beyond an initial fee of $125 for a two-month “try out” that helps Defy organizers see if the person is right for the year-long program that offers so much value. When asked what the costs of the program would be,  Vasquez said it wasn’t yet determined. For ex-inmates, that screams hustle, not opportunity. It came off too much like an Amway meeting than a serious training opportunity.

    But the proof is the work already done in NY, and clearly Defy is defying the odds. There is no hustle other than to build connections between experts and successful business leaders and ex-inmates determined to make a business of their own.

    The program is truly innovative and the kinks will work themselves out. The professionalism of the event will get better. A local staff would go a long way to improving recruitment to create a genuine competitive environment for candidates. The idea is a good one. This should be only for those dedicated enough to have “skin in the game” as they explained.

    If Defy Ventures builds a local staff those rooms could be full. Word of mouth — boots on the ground — are badly needed. Also, once those rooms are full, the vetting process will be real, sifting to find those determined to invest a year of their life in a program that will assuredly change it.  Further, a program touting professionalism will learn to model it at every step.

    Oakland needs a Defy Ventures. It’s the perfect expansion area. Vasquez spoke of future programs in places like Chicago and Texas. The big backers behind Defy and its pool of [more than 2,000 experts](http://defyventures.org/take-action/volunteer/) offering instruction, mentoring and finances will bolster it tremendously. Started by a former venture capitalist, the money problems that plaque most non-profits seems handled. The future is bright.

    Of all the things that [Defy Ventures](http://defyventures.org/), the real human connections remains the gold standard. As Vasquez spoke about, and he himself has benefited tremendously already, ex-inmates and CEOs don’t often find common ground to get to know one another. But through the Defy program, not only do the get to know each other, they seem themselves in each other. Mentoring relationships, that human connection is the secret sauce for breaking the cycle of recidivism. When your cared about and encouraged by person who is running her own company, it impacts you differently than being mentored by the local dealer.

    The human touch. It starts and ends there.

    That’s where the revolution occurs.

  title: School-to-prison pipeline reform breaks flow at source
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Zero-tolerance discipline in schools have coincided nicely with the run-up of mass incarceration in America. Schools became a feeder program, culling the so-called “troubled” students and funneling them toward prisons through the school-to-prison pipeline.

    Now communities most affected by such policies – mostly urban, underprivileged and minority schools – are fighting back, seeking to save their kids from the supposedly inevitable fate of a lifetime behind bars.

    The Syracuse school district has exploded in what can accurately be described as a civil rights battle ground. The conflict spilled into the public in June during a widely attended, highly emotional school board meeting where the Syracuse Teachers Association showed up en masse to announce they had near unanimous approval from union members to issue a vote of no-confidence in district superintendent Sylvia Contreras (pictured above).

    STA President Kevin Ahern said Contreras had failed to ensure a safe teaching and learning environment in schools, that working conditions have deteriorated under her leadership and that she has failed to provide leadership needed to address problems in the schools.

    “The Syracuse Teacher’s Association urges this Board of Education to immediately enter into negotiations with Superintendent Contreras for a mutually agreed upon and expedited departure date,” Ahern said before walking out of the rest of the meeting with the supporting teachers in attendance.

    The local civil rights groups and community leaders fought back.

    Patrice Chang levies the blame for the rising tensions on the leadership of Ahern, not the leadership of Contreras.

    “Kevin Ahern has a mission in mind that is not only self-motivated but also anti-Sharon Contreras as the superintendent, because she is making changes that affects the privilege seats that the STA white members have held for decades. Kevin Ahern is filled with racially driven implicit biases,” Chang said.

    Chang, a district parent and member of the NAACP education committee, and Walt Dixie, who heads up the local National Action Network, have urged the national civil rights leaders to come to Syracuse and pick up the important fight to break the school-to-prison pipeline that plagues urban communities.

    But the wait, so far anyway, has been for nothing.

    “It’s been weeks and we haven’t gotten a response. We’re waiting for a response,” Dixie said.

    Meanwhile, the school-to-prison pipeline has grown in the public eye throughout the country as leaders — from President Obama, to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, to Sens. Corey Booker of New Jersey and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who teamed up on prison reform legislation, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo who recently released his own prison reform agenda — turn their collective attention to the growing issue of epidemic incarceration and the disproportionate incarceration of minorities after decades of indifference.

    But strangely at a time when the country is turning to the issue, the national civil rights leaders remain on the sidelines in the battleground of Syracuse, according to the local leaders there.

    “They have to be willing to get into the weeds, Dixie said. “At the end of the day we need Rev. Sharpton to get involved. We recognize they have national issues but we are addressing this on a local level and it’s a national issue. This issue has brought us all together in a way that says, ‘we aren’t taking this shit no more.’ They do a lot of great work, but we are going to do this with their support or without their support.”

    Dixie acknowledged the fight with the unions — a key Democratic constituency — could be part of the reluctance of national civil rights leaders to join the battle. But he insists the battle can be solved.

    “They can support unions and still ask for accountability,” Dixie says.

    Asked if she too is frustrated with a lack of response from the national civil rights leadership, Chang says no.

    “Perhaps we are reaching out to the wrong people, and their covers are blown. No frustration here, just revelations,” Chang says.

    Their covers are blown indeed.

    Meanwhile grassroots and innovative efforts for solutions have emerged, including one Criminal U has become actively involved in: Inside Innovations.

    We’re talking prison reform at the most urgent level: kids. With a serious effort to turn young inmates flushed by the school-to-prison pipeline into budding entrepreneurs who make meaningful contributions to the very communities they once committed crimes in.

    Let the likes of Rev. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson sit on the sidelines of this issue. Become a part of the movement to affect meaningful, positive, permanent change. Join the chorus of empowerment and reform.

  title: Conservative prison reform leads way to Tipping Point
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    To date there are few heroes politically in prison reform. Neither party cared at all, until very, very recently. Now suddenly we’re reading about it often. We’re hearing words like conservative prison reform all tied together.

    The Republicans invented “tough on crime” and used it to crush Democrats and make the term liberal synonymous with “weak.” They invented the epidemic of mass incarceration and profited the most from it.

    Democrats simply ducked. They sat back and watched piles of legislation become law and send Americans away to prisons for years and years. They stood silent as rehabilitation programs were dismantled because all the money went to guards. Many had districts profit just like Republicans as prisons sprouted up like Starbucks. Through it all they cowered.

    Worse, they often went silently along, voting yes to the latest and greatest way to fund the industrialized prison economy that led to both the epidemic of mass incarceration and the billion-dollar boondoggle of America’s prison system.

    Someday history will properly record the blight this era has been. There were no heroes.

    But that’s changing rapidly… almost so rapidly that we hesitate to keep up. That tipping point we’ve been talking about since before this site existed may actually be here. Just consider this: [Conservative prison reform](http://www.rightoncrime.com/). Three words not usually linked.

    It’s hard for me to grasp even as I write this, but if you don’t believe me (and my guts don’t believe me at all…”fool me once…”) listen to this conversation, at CPAC of all places:
    Now a measure of caution is warranted. Did you catch Gov. Rick Perry.. “we’re smart on crime…” and “we shut a prison down!”?

    Well, he’s not exactly our role model here.

    Since 2010 Texas has executed 63 inmates. Ray Jasper, the 64th is scheduled for execution in mere hours. During that same span, all other 49 states combined executed 84 people.

    Killing people isn’t exactly a humane, restorative method of prison reform.

    But the simple fact of the coming Tipping Point is now beyond a doubt. Money talks, especially with the GOP. The expense of the prison industry outweighs the profits. That is the tipping point.

    Grover Norquist is remarkably consistent. He hates taxes. He hates government. He hates it all… and nothing burns through tax dollars and fuels big government these days like a criminal justice system that costs between $50 billion and $74 billion a year. He had plenty to say about reform.

    The political will that has been lacking for those so deathly afraid of being labeled soft on crime. These leaders at CPAC are providing political cowards political cover so they can start to work on toppling this taxpayer albatross.

    Who would have thought the civil rights agenda of Eric Holder would align with the likes of Rick Perry? Not Rick Perry, as he said in the video, but there it is. He said, not me.

    Of all people, Perry got this right. Nobody is asking for soft on crime, not even prison reform advocates like me. I’ve lived with inmates. I’ve been one. We’re not an easy group and certainly justice has its place. But that place, long forgotten, is right along side rehabilitation, restorative justice and reform.

  title: Flowers’ relentless optimism counters problem of juvenile sentencing
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "I’ve been corresponding with a man who has been in prison
    for nearly two decades. He has never known a day of adulthood spent outside the
    barbed wires and bars of America’s prisons. He was part of a great wave of sentencing
    that lowered the rate of adulthood in our culture for only one exception: to try
    children as adults and lock them up forever.\n\nThis man put a human face — a
    relentlessly optimistic face– on the problem of juvenile sentencing in this country.\n\nThis
    man’s name is Halim Flowers and before I tell you about him, let me tell you about
    a boy named Kahton Anderson who walked onto a bus and shot the wrong guy. As best
    we can tell it was an act of gang violence, likely ordered from an adult who this
    boy feared. We don’t know why it happened, we only know an innocent bystander
    was killed and now Anderson will be tried as an adult. \n\nAs the *New York Times*
    reported, this type of sentencing arose back when Flowers was a boy, in response
    to academic predictions that “superpredators,” youths in gang (in other words,
    black youths) would spill innocent blood like never seen before. It didn’t happen.\n\nCrime
    actually decreased for those under 18 dramatically. But the sentencing laws enacted
    on the basis of this unrealized fear did happen.\n\n> “It energized a movement,
    as one state after another enacted laws making it possible to try children as
    young as 13 or 14 as adults. (New York had such a law even earlier, and it is
    now being applied to Kahton Anderson.) Many hundreds of juveniles were sent to
    prison for life, though in the last few years the United States Supreme Court
    has ruled that such sentences must not be automatic, even in murder cases. Individual
    circumstances and possible mitigating factors should be weighed, the justices
    said.”\n\nvia [When Youth Violence Spurred ‘Superpredator’ Fear – NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/politics/killing-on-bus-recalls-superpredator-threat-of-90s.html?hp).\n\nLegally
    children under the age of 18 cannot give consent to anything. They simply are
    not responsible adults by the definition of the law. But if they murder someone,
    or in the case of Flowers, hang around someone who murders someone, they can be
    deemed adults so they can spend the rest of their lives in a place that will treat
    them like children, horrifically poorly treated children, but children nonetheless.\n\nThis
    is the rite of passage in American society. Wonderful tradition, isn’t it? This
    is exactly why I wrote Rules 101 for my son on his 18th birthday. We are desperate
    for cogent thinking that goes beyond crime and punishment.\n\nNow let me tell
    you about Halim Flowers, a relentlessly positive inmate who sets the standard
    for reform. Or better yet, let someone who knows him better than I tell you, criminal
    justice consultant Nikki Elliot:\n> Halim Flowers is a beautiful and talented
    soul who made a mistake as a 16 year-old teenager and who was sentenced to 30
    years to Life for it. Since those long 17 years ago, Halim has turned his trials
    and tribulations into learning and turning totally around from his mistakes years
    ago. His metamorphosis has transformed into a motivational speaker, teacher, financial
    advisor, author of five books, poet, life coach and so much more. Halim is also
    the special guest host on Youtube videos for National Poetry Month and, he never
    ceases to amaze me and so many others with his loving heart, beautiful mind and
    talented soul in continuing to write worldly wisdom.\n\nHere’s a list of his books
    (available on Amazon.com):\n•\t*A Reason To Breathe*\n•\t*A Reason To Breathe
    Volume II: Til My Last Breath!*\n•\tBuried Alive: Dead Men Do Talk\n•\t*Mind Over
    Matter*\n•\t*What Our Fathers Never Told Us*\n\nResearching even further, I saw
    on a website named “Access Legal Aide” where Halim had written letters from the
    “inside” and which are posted on that site. All of his letters were soulfully,
    articulately, and motivationally written. One letter in particular stood further
    out to me. Please see an excerpt from this letter below:\n> “I was convicted of
    aiding and abetting a murder. I was not charged as the shooter, just my presence
    along with the commission of the felony was enough to secure me a mandatory 30
    years to life sentence. I was only sixteen at the time of my offense. During my
    incarceration, I have attended college, acquired numerous vocational trades, mentored
    younger prisoners, counseled suicidal inmates, and I have accepted responsibility
    for my past destructive actions and continue to demonstrate sincere remorse through
    my efforts to avoid violence and to help others from preying on weaker inmates.
    I have seen many of my ‘non-violent’ prisoner peers come in and out of prison
    during my 16 years of incarceration. Just because I was a part of a violent offense,
    am I not deserving of a second chance to see if I can be a mature law-abiding
    ‘adult’ citizen in society or shall I be forever condemned for my bad choices
    that I made as a minor?”\n\nHalim is also currently in the process of working
    with the nonprofit organization “Think Outside The Cell” in New York City on their
    Civic Duty Initiative to help inmates perform and do positive deeds for people
    in society. This Civic Duty Initiative program recently sponsored the first ever
    gun-buy-back funded by inmates in a New York State prison. Furthermore, Halim
    is planning to work with Think Outside the Cell on a book based on how inmates
    can give back to their communities positively while serving their sentences in
    prison.\n\nPlease support Halim in his prosperity and allow his heart, wisdom,
    experience, teachings, and passion to continue helping so many; while at the same
    time helping yourself to gain knowledge, transition, and dedication that you never
    knew you had until reading Halim’s life-changing books.\n\nYou can also write
    to Halim at:\nHalim A. Flowers\n#11967-007\nUSP Atlanta\nP.O. Box 150160\nAtlanta,

  title: Petey Pablo touts prison spreads upon release
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Rapper Petey Pablo may have loved the spreads in prison, but I doubt he’ll be cooking any recipes from my book, “[Prison Spreads 101](http://www.amazon.com/Prison-Spreads-101-culture-recipes-ebook/dp/B00GS7QH06/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1388773371&sr=8-11&keywords=bolsinger)″ anytime soon. What’s great in prison loses by comparison to the world’s buffet of fresh foods and choices.  But that didn’t stop Pablo from touting his personal prison chef upon his release from federal prison on Thursday.

    Pablo said he did his best to live in style while serving time for a gun charge. He told TMZ he paid another inmate to cook his meals using food purchased from the commissary and cooked in microwaves. Dishes, he said, included chicken, pizza and rice and beans.

    Pablo’s favorite, [according to TMZ](http://www.tmz.com/2014/03/13/petey-pablo-jail-chef-microwave-gun-charges/), was a spicy rice bowl with jalapenos and available meat.

    “It was some of the best food you could ever make in a microwave,” Pablo said.

    Pablo’s likely done with prison spreads however. The rapper said he’ll stay away from both crime and guns as he re-launches his music career.

    Pablo was sentenced to 35 months following his arrest in 2010. Pablo was at Raleigh-Durham International Airport carrying a stolen 9mm semi-automatic handgun when he was arrested. He was sent to Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institute.

    Before he launched his music career he served five years for an armed robbery in New York. While in prison he met Busta Rhymes and Black Rob who helped him launch his career.

    Inmates often get out of prison and try to recreate the spreads they made inside, a sort of tortured trip down memory lane. I even brought with me an entire box full of commissary and the few cooking utensils I’d use to make them — an ajax lid for a cheese grater, a plastic ruler for a knife, a small plastic bowl — so the experience for my friends would be truly authentic.

    I made them burrito bowls, ramen tuna sandwiches and peanut butter chocolate cheesecake. My friends raved about it. One convinced me to write an e-book about it, which I did. The book highlights what we consider the “best food” inside, is also the same stuff that is the cheapest, most processed and dangerous for people outside. It may taste surprisingly good, but it will make you fat and kill you eventually.

    The industrialized food system and the industrialized prison system are two highly profitable, billion-dollar enterprises that profits a few at the expense of millions. Together they are deadly.

    It’s just another example of how, despite the barbed wires and bars that separate us, the human issues of health, well-being and life are very much the same. The same struggles for the poor, the marginalized and the powerless outside are very real to those inside.

    And Petey if you stumble across this… I’ll challenge your chef to a IronChef Prison Spread contest any day. You can be the judge. It’s on!

  title: 'The problem of prison reform: the victim'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Can you show compassion for a criminal without dishonoring the pain they caused their victim? It’s a question I think about in this odd course of my life. It’s a question that haunts me more today knowing that very, very soon a human being will be killed and they will call it justice. Ray Jasper, a thoughtful, articulate, troubled man will die, barring a stay of execution that is almost certainly not going to come.

    When [Gawker posted a letter](http://gawker.com/a-letter-from-ray-jasper-who-is-about-to-be-executed-1536073598) Jasper wrote (Jasper did not solicit the opportunity, nor ask to promote it in anyway) it became a part of the historical debate over the death penalty in this country. People will read it long after he is gone. It also stirred tremendous compassion and support across the country.

    Best selling author Michelle Alexander wrote, “Ray Jasper’s life has meaning and value no matter what horrible things he has done in his past, including taking another man’s life. In my view, the minute we imagine that someone – anyone – is unworthy of our concern we begin to lose touch with our own humanity.”

    It’s easy to see why Alexander is a best-selling author. It’s also easy to see why Ray Jasper’s letter is so important.

    But what about the victim? This is the point of the spear. Do we victimize them twice when we talk about the rehabilitation and worth of the criminal?

    Once more I defer to the expert: “I also believe that victims, their families, and communities have a right to be heard, which is why I support restorative justice as an alternative to our purely punitive, revenge-based system of mass incarceration and capital punishment,” Alexander wrote.

    I can’t help thinking about the letter from Jasper’s victim’s brother, Stephan Alejandro. It chronicles the hurt, the unimaginable hurt the victims of all crimes carry with them and his painful memories of his brother David who Jasper himself called the “nicest man he’d ever met.”

    Again Alexander drives home the point far better than I: “If Ray Jasper has not fully admitted to himself or to those he has harmed the gravity of what he has done, and if he has not – as best he can – attempted to make amends, he has failed to learn what his letter is trying to teach: true empathy.”

    This all forces me to reconsider the hurt my victims carry with them. It brings the issue home. I carry my victims with me when I write and work and try to rebuild my life. I’m nearly always aware, even if there is little of value I can do. Some will want me to only experience misery. I respect that, though I don’t agree I deserve this.

    I worry about their feelings more often than I could rightly express, but I also know my life must go on. I need to live and do the best I can with the life I have left. I do what I do under the scepter of how important it is that I do the right thing, every small thing, to the very best of my ability every single day going forward. This is my responsibility. To live, yes, but to live rightly.

    If Jasper’s letter will remain, so too must Alejandro’s. Side by side they force us beyond the politics, the rhetoric and perhaps even the hate just long enough to see what this is really about: the people.

    I am stridently against the death penalty. It doesn’t take a lot of research to know beyond a shadow of a doubt we can’t execute correctly, perfectly, without blemish. We know for a fact innocent people have been executed. We know for a fact that blacks are executed far, far, far more often than whites. We know the drugs they use are flawed and that the so-called humane killing is nothing of the sort.

    But the debate shouldn’t crowd out the victim. Rehabilitation and reform should also seek to restore. Somehow we have to find a way past the hate and the revenge toward a philosophy of justice inexorably tied to mercy that honors the victim’s pain without giving them the “right” to revenge. Somehow in that emotional quagmire lies flawed but better solutions to move forward. It too won’t be perfect, but we won’t be killing, dehumanizing, warehousing human beings as we do in the current system. We may find some winners unlike now, like when Ray Jasper is executed and so clearly everyone associated has experienced so much terrible loss.

  title: Call centers coveted jobs inside Criminal U
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    For people exhausted by the intrusive telemarketers the following is probably going to piss them off even more: Some of those calls are coming from convicted felons calling from *inside prisons*.

    It's like this: “Hello, is this Bob? My name is Steve and I’m calling to tell you about this great deal…” says a guy with “inmate” stamped in neon colors across his back so that the guards with guns in the towers overlooking the yard can better aim should he try to make a run for it.

    A strange picture huh?

    The federal government calls it “[the best-kept secret in outsourcing](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/01/12/10140493-inside-the-secret-industry-of-inmate-staffed-call-centers)” — providing inmates to staff call centers and other services in both the private and public sectors.

    And the feds aren’t alone. Many states use inmate labor, states like Oregon, featured by [USA Today](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/employment/2004-07-06-call-center_x.htm?csp=34) in 2004.

    As for the inmates making the calls? It’s often the most coveted job inside Criminal U.

    Nobody likes call centers, except those making money from them. As it turns out, there are plenty of these folks around, because as much as call centers are dragged to the public whipping post, they continue to outperform in an increasingly brutal business.

    Call center companies are the ugly ducklings of a stock portfolio. They aren’t sexy. You don’t brag about them at happy hour. But they remain relevant investments. They’re the obnoxious cousin of your portfolio.

    Because they operate on very small profit margins, call centers increasingly use inmate labor that costs them less than overseas labor. Ironically, call center jobs are one example the government had in mind when it set a goal to “repatriate” jobs back onshore. While American companies may not like the federal government using inmate labor competing with them, the government has shown its more than willing to use inmate labor to compete with overseas jobs, even if that means it will eventually compete with jobs back home.

    Unicor, [the brand name that cloaks Federal Prison Industries](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/02/10/furniture-giant-set-to-battle-innovate-again.aspx?source=isesitlnk0000001&mrr=1.00), makes about $10 million a year in profits from supplying a labor force that costs less than $1 an hour in most instances. This is a perfect example of the “unfair labor advantages” that both the United States Chamber of Commerce and The AFL-CIO have complained to Congress about.

    Unicor services as many as a dozen different companies through its call center services. According to MSNBC, the government will not disclose the names of those actual companies. It becomes impossible to assess the impact on competition.

    This is the exact conundrum that weaves in and out of a billion-dollar prison system. The inmates actually benefit. They often get bonuses that pay them better than the typical wages of others inside. They learn a skill that can get them a job in call centers once they are released.

    But customers don’t know who they are talking to when those inmates call, nor do they know what companies are using inmate labor. Business owners are infuriated by the unfair competition, but they can’t put a finger on who and how to express the frustration. And Unicor just keeps right on building its brand, flying low on the radar with its “best kept secret” far from the bright lights of public scrutiny.

    That’s been the formula for the entire industrialized prison economy in our culture, and it’s worked exceedingly well for those, like the federal government and major businesses with political connections to profit from it. What makes this unusual is the inmates actually benefit as well. Such is the tangled web we weave inside Criminal U.

  title: Yoga volunteers help to re-introduce human beings
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I invited John to yoga shortly after he arrived back to prison for another short sentence. John had treated me well when I first arrived at the state pen. He had spent more than 20 years in places far worse than that, places like Leavenworth and Bloody Beaumont, federal prisons that are known by reputation and depravity. The state pen seemed plenty enough depraved for me. John’s guidance proved critical, not just to adapting, but to navigating my entire journey through Criminal U.

    When John came back I had a chance to repay him. He was now off balance, the first time he’d ever been to a minimum-security prison. I had been at this particular prison a while and had established myself. I could help get him settled in a foreign environment just as he had once done for me.

    Minimum-security prison can be very tough on those used to places like John had been. Mentally, the lack of familiarity had John what I call “running hot.” Anxiety creased his brow. His temper ran like a revved engine. Other inmates saw him flash often enough to keep a wide distance.

    That’s why I invited him to yoga. Nothing– not visits, not letters and calls home, not prayer, nothing — had helped me more on a week-to-week basis than the 90-minute yoga class offered by two volunteers each week. When they started the program, I was there the first day. I was there every single week for nearly 18 months until the week I went home. I still talk to my yoga teacher. He remains one of the angel’s God sent my way, light sent into a dark place, week after week.

    John came to the class and soon was sweating, breathing hard, struggling to keep up despite being a guy who had always worked hard to stay in shape. The effort surprised him. When the class started to wind down, Yoga Jim as I called him, invited us to “stretch out for savasana” as he did at the end of every class.  We lie on our back, perfectly still, eyes closed (something you just never ever did in prison other than on our bunk). For ten minutes of guided meditation, the prison faded away. Peace floated in. As we ended, I felt once again, ready for the rest of the week.

    I met John on the way out. Tears stained his face. His body looked like melting butter. A tremendous weight of something few would ever understand just dropped off of him.

    “I’ve never experienced anything like that,” he told me quietly. “I’ve never… uh… I just felt calm for the first time in more than twenty years.”

    Yoga in prisons is a godsend. It’s virtually free, almost always led by outside volunteers conducting service. It costs prisons nothing other than to provide space.

    Yet far too often it isn’t available. Or in places like the state pen, the waiting list takes a year or two at the least just to get in the class. Yoga Jim and his helper Tanya — herself a retired counselor in the Department of Corrections — are the only teachers covering three prisons. Two people volunteering time have touched hundreds of hardened men in ways that no state program could. I’ve experienced it. I’ve seen it in others. I’ve watched the change in men as they come to do something they never thought they would.

    I was first taught yoga by my cellie at the state pen. We couldn’t get into the class, so we’d go out on the yard and face the 30-foot walls with snipers perched above and do our sun salutations. It was the only time in prison I turned my back on other inmates and could care less what they said or did.

    My cellie was doing ten years. He was hardened, a man with a violent pass and trigger temper. He’d say often how the industrialized prison system had been intent on crushing him. Yoga had become a way for him to feel human again. He taught me every other day. His only challenge to me was that I be willing to serve others as he served me. If they asked, he wanted me to share what he taught me.

    Months later I moved to a different prison. I’d head out to the yard and continue my yoga practice. Soon after I arrived the yoga class needed someone new to lead the poses. I knew only what my cellie had taught me. I’d never been to a real class before. But I did as I promised I would and agreed to lead the class. More than 40 different men learned what my cellie taught me. More lives were changed. I saw it with my own eyes. And it didn’t cost the state a cent.

    The *Texas Tribune* ran [a story](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/us/if-the-sun-salutation-has-to-fit-into-a-cell.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss) about a similar program. [Conviction Yoga](http://convictionyoga.com/index.html), operated by a 48-year-old lawyer in Texas, began just this past summer. Jim Freeman (another Yoga Jim!) spends about $300 a week driving to four prisons around Austin. The state only has to open its doors and provide a space.

    Freeman told the newspaper what I heard from Yoga Jim and Tanya countless times.

    “I just see them as men,” Freeman said of the inmates. “And men that are starving for something.”

    The chaplain at a prison Freeman conducts his classes said the corrections officers noticed better behavior from “those who took part in spiritual programs that gave them a chance to exercise,” the newspaper reported.

    Likewise, my teachers Yoga Jim and Tanya would remind us at least once a month that we were human beings.

    “When you walk through those doors you are not an inmate. You are a yoga student. You are not the crime that brought you here,” they’d say.

    For men with “INMATE” stamped to their chest, back and legs, it was a powerful reminder.

    Tanya would also challenge us, by asking, “Who are you going to introduce to the world when you walk out that gate?”

    I like who I introduced to the world. Those around me tell me they like the person I introduced to them as well. I worked hard at who I would be. I worked hard at recovery. I still do. But I give a lot of credit to these two angels who taught me yoga.

    I like seeing the transformation in people like John and my friend Charly and many others who simply had the opportunity to do a little yoga in prison.

    Rehabilitating inmates is a daunting challenge. Far more will relapse, commit more crimes and return to prison than those that will turn their first enrollment at Criminal U into a solitary experience. But with so many programs like Conviction Yoga in Texas, or the work of simple volunteers in Oregon showing real progress, why can’t we focus instead on what we can do and what helps a little instead of dwelling on what we can’t and all that is wrong with those who live their lives behind the bars and barbed wires of America prisons?

  title: Correctional officers can perpetuate cycle of crime
  author: Halim Flowers
  contentAboveNewsletter: "\nVery often I encounter a situation in prison where a
    staff member is being very unprofessional. A lot of inmates complain about the
    poor behavior of correctional officers toward them and even their family members
    that come to visit them in prison.\n\nI have to remind myself constantly that
    any idiot that can pass a civil service exam today can be in a position of authority
    in prison tomorrow. Not much professionalism nor education is required to stand
    in the tower over inmates with an assault rifle to shoot them in a moment of chaos
    nor to turn the key at night and count bodies. I often forget that I am not in
    the custody of individuals that are “Rhode’s Scholars.”\n\nFemale officers can
    sometimes be in a position where she feels as though that she has to constantly
    assert her authority in a prison environment full of men. This usually leads to
    her being overly aggressive in minor situations that breeds unnecessary tension.
    In her mind, maybe she says, “I’m following policy!” She may not be able to see
    that she is being tyrannical, maybe she doesn’t care because inmates are animals
    worthy of human rights deprivation.\n\nDealing with the stressors of prison are
    often exaggerated by the assertive culture of correctional officers deeming it
    mandatory to constantly frustrate and annoy their captors. When education and
    communication skills are lacking, then their can be no reasoning nor rationality
    between staff and inmate. In a correctional setting, how can someone that has
    embraced a culture of authoritative bullying be in a position to “correct” those
    that are under their authority?\n\nA lot of times we read about a prisoner that
    returns to society to commit a heinous crime. No one ever thinks to blame the
    penal system that was responsible for correcting the inmate’s behaviors for society.
    What happens to the menace to society when he enters a department of corrections
    that has no concern for his rehabilitation nor the correction of his anti-social
    disorders? The response is usually to increase the mandatory minimum sentences
    for crimes and to revoke parole for prisoners. This is the veneer to shade the
    lack of prison officials enthusiasm and skills to correct those that are under
    their custody. Instead, they adopt the easy course of isolating them from society
    and merely punishing them because they do not want to admit that they cannot and
    do not care to prepare their wards to transition into society as productive citizens.\n\nWhen
    we think about life inside, think about those in power to truly change it? If
    it’s broken, which every statistic tells us it is, then why aren’t we fixing it?\n\nWhat
    is stopping you from being great?\n\n> “In life, the real war is fought in your
    mind. The battlefield is the land of your ideas. Your ideas are far more valuable
    than any natural resources such as oil, gold, and other minerals that men continue
    to fight wars for. Without the treasure of the ideas, man would not know the value
    in use for oil and other resources. What is oil but liquid mud to the man (mind)

    about the authors of The Federalist Papers, James Madison, John Jay, and Alexander
    Hamilton. When people resolve to influence the direction of the masses, then they
    understand that they must drop leaflets before bombs.\n\nThe worst form of imprisonment
    is to incarcerate the ideas that we hold dearest to us. Oftentimes we do this
    because our vision does not “fit in” with the paradigm that society has imposed
    upon us as “normal” through cultural traditions. However, the world has always
    been in search of those Halima willing to dare to be great enough to be who they
    truly desire to be. Copernicus and Galileo had the gall to inform the masses that
    the earth was not the center of the universe at the expense of their lives and

  title: 'Rule #22: Hold on loosely'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I sat on a prison bus, shackled and chained, hands twisted in a black box, allegedly invented by a former inmate.

    The morning dawn had just cracked the glass of night on a new day. I was outside the 30-foot walls of the penitentiary for the first time in months. Still not free, nowhere near free, but getting closer.

    The bus would drive across the state all day with only one stop at a prison mid-way. We’d be given a sandwich between our shackled hands to eat by hunching over. Eight hours later we’d arrive at a prison known as “powder puff pen,” the softest prison in the state and home to an alcohol and drug program that would help earn early release.

    As we embarked, two songs played in succession.

    First, *The Breakfast Club* anthem of the 1980s classic, "*Don’t you forget about me*” played softly over the tiny speakers in the steel box we rode in. I wished I could shove my hand up in victory like the rebel at the end of the movie.

    I did so in my mind while my hands stayed chained to my waist. *Don’t forget about me*, I prayed. I’m almost home.

    Next, came the reminder song, the nudge that tells me time and again that nothing is certain in life: *Hold on Loosely*, by 38 Special.

    Those three words crystallized a key rule I’d often struggled to explain, which in essence states if you cling to anything or anyone too fiercely, you’ll lose it. You’ll choke it to death. The challenge is to enjoy the moment rather than stress protecting it for all time.

    So take heed. Love fiercely, but hold on loosely.

    We fear loss. *Terrify* is probably a better word than fear in this context. The Great Recession showed how terrified Americans were of losing their money, for example. Panic sets in as relationships shift and loss seems possible. We hold on so tight –- be it our high-school child about to graduate or five-year sweetheart who seems distant-– we choke them to death.

    Consider the gospel telling of future saints Peter and John’s reaction to sitting in on a meeting between Jesus and God, a rare time when heaven and earth connected before human eyes. Rather than shut up and soak it in, rather than bask in the honor of this incredible occurrence, they tried to squeeze the life out of it.

    “Hey Jesus, how about we set up some tents here so we can hang out forever,” they said!
    Jesus just shook his head. Maybe he even belly laughed. They meant well, but they didn’t get it. Hold on to the memory, don’t strangle the moment.

    Heaven on Earth moments are fleeting on this side. So hold on loosely when they occur and count yourself blessed.

    I remind myself of this when I look at old pictures of my children. They were different people back then. Incredible, tiring, exhilarating and exasperating bundles of insanity. I loved them and their antics. I loved being their hero. I loved the bear hugs.

    But, I miss those kids so much. I can’t believe their gone. I have a picture of my middle daughter and my son on my nightstand. I’ve kept it there all these years. I see it and the memories of their antics – those two were inseparable and they played all the time with abandon! – makes me smile every time. Their relationship is much harder these days. As adults its far more complicated. They’ve even (temporarily, I’m sure) lost sight of how much they have in common. I miss them together.

    But no amount of squeezing could stop the passage of time. For them to become these intelligent, complicated, enjoyable adults I know now, they had to leave behind those crazy kids I knew then. I’ve held on loosely to them all their lives and in so doing captured the best of them. I’m still adding to the collection. I’m still seeing the new them. Because as the next line in the song goes, “Hold on loosely, just don’t let go.”

    They know I’ll never let go. Not ever. No way.

    Loving relationships aren’t about control. They flow from freedom. They work best, like hitting a baseball, when gripped lightly. A white-knuckle approach to life will result in loss that far outweighs the inevitable loss that comes with the passage of time.

    Times change. Things change. Health changes. Finances change. Happiness, or the lack thereof, changes. Change is the one thing we can count on most. So holding too tight does nothing to stop the assault of change. It robs us of the moment.

    On the flip side, when life feels devoid of all hope of purpose, that inevitable march of change works to our favor. Hope emerges like a single budding plant, full of the looming potential harvest in the certain knowledge of change. So take heed in the dark times. Hold on. The good times will return.

    Seize the day, the poet writes.

    Loosely, I add.

  title: Prison gardens a rare light inside darkness of Criminal U
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    On theme I return to time and again is that the commonalities between inmates and free citizens are greater than one would expect. The whole “there but the grace of God go I” concept helps deconstruct the emotional barriers that are far more significant than barbed wire and bars.

    Our humanity remains the tie that binds and the best hope for genuine reform. It directly confronts the indifference society has for those locked up, which is just as precisely captured in the popular prison guard refrain of “you don’t like, don’t come to prison.”

    Neither position is without merit, but one might be more useful in finding genuine solutions to America’s epidemic incarceration problem.

    Food remains one of the most significant unifiers I’ve seen, which is why [I wrote about it](http://www.amazon.com/Prison-Spreads-101-culture-recipes-ebook/dp/B00GS7QH06/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1388773371&sr=8-11&keywords=bolsinger) first when we started this website. A [recent blog on NPR shows](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/01/12/261397333/prison-gardens-help-inmates-grow-their-own-food-and-skills) just how important the food culture can be, even in prison. One particular program that uses prison garden training in prison as a catalyst to living-wage landscape jobs outside has a recidivism rate of 10 percent. With the national average stubbornly holding at roughly two-thirds, this is no small accomplishment.

    Beyond stats, I have seen the redemptive power of prison gardens. The jobs in gardens are coveted. Those who get them feel transported beyond the barbed wires and bars every day. They also get training. In one prison program I saw, students could earn a college extension certificate in organic gardening. That food often made it into the prison kitchen, lights of brilliance in an otherwise dark sky.

    But it remains a less than perfect system. In one fabulous prison garden I saw — largely the result of one eager staffer and a lot of inmate labor — the food went largely to waste and rarely made it into the kitchen because the food coordinators didn’t want to bother with fresh produce.

    Like all things within the Department of Corrections, prison gardens are largely hit and miss with their effectiveness. When volunteers like the one I cite above organize, the results usually exceed DOC-coordinated efforts.

    The bottom line is these things that make us human and restore life are not difficult or even expensive. They just take someone to care, and more often than not, that remains the biggest obstacle.

  title: 'Rule #7: Be positive'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Positive people make us laugh on television. Most of the time we are laughing at them. Sometimes we are laughing at how ridiculous they are. But television picks  up on a thread, something innately funny, in creating relentlessly positive characters.

    Take fan favorite Chris Traeger of *Parks and Recreation*, played by Rob Lowe. Lowe’s six-episode guest appearance turned into more than 80 shows and an Emmy nomination because his unflinchingly positive character was too funny to let go.

    My favorite Chris Traeger positivism quote is this line:
    “I take care of my body above all else. Diet, exercise, supplements, positive thinking. Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born. I believe I am that human being.”

    It’s funny because it’s sort of the way I think. I follow the radical life extension efforts. I believe a huge shift in aging will come in the next thirty years, a time when I’m supposed to start getting old. But I won’t. I think we’ll delay it and see people live healthy, happy lives into the one hundreds. I think I will live a healthy, happy life into my one hundreds.

    See, hilarious right? Stop chuckling at me right now!

    Why is positivity so funny?

    Because like all things funny, a sunny disposition seems so extreme as compared to our normal daily existence. Think about that for a moment.

    That’s sad, isn’t it. Why should relentless positivity be abnormal?

    For starters you might say, “look around” and you’d be right. It’s a tough world out there. Life’s lessons come with kicks to the gut and rips to the heart. Idealism hangs precariously to a weathered vine like fruit in a drought.

    Life in such a tough world can make any positive outlook seem idealistic and ridiculous. Cynicism is in, fashionable, intelligent and admired. Cynicism is also lazy, the easy way to skip through life, comment on much of it and yet leave few lasting marks beyond a ripple of water that quickly disappears. Cynicism, well, that’s a keeper.

    Until, you actually get around people and get to know them. Cynics tend to wear you out. Positive people tend to make you feel better, more energized. It’s the exact opposite of what’s portrayed on TV.

    Positivity is infectious. Hence, Rule #7: be positive.

    The reason for this rule is it will make you feel better and make others feel better around you. It works. Science backs me up on this one. Tell that inner cynic to listen up a moment.

    Perhaps the most successful method of treating non-chemical depression is Cognitive Behavior Therapy, which boiled down is teaching people to be positive.

    The predominant therapy for addiction, criminal behavior and lifestyle training offered inside America’s prisons is CBT. The most effective way so far to break criminal thinking, it has been proven, is to change the thinking to a more positive outlook.

    It’s really simple. Our thoughts shape our attitudes and beliefs. Over time those attitude and beliefs are cemented and fuel our actions. If we think a certain way, sooner or later we will act on it.

    This can work negatively. For example, someone faithfully married begins to consider an affair. They may have a relatively innocuous relationship with another person. Over time the thought of having that affair is repeated in the mind over and over until the beliefs and attitudes about it change. Soon, the destructive act is underway.

    But it can also work positively. Someone beat down by life tells themselves hundreds of times a day that they are no good. Their mind continues to play negative thoughts over and over again with predictable outcomes. Life sucks. Until, they are taught to weed out those those thoughts at the root. They learn to repeat positive things. They train their brain to think with a positive outlook. Soon, they see all the positive things they missed before. Their attitudes and beliefs change. They act differently with more positive results.

    It works. For all the complexities of the human condition — we are indeed “fearfully and wonderfully made” — some of our wiring is pretty elementary.

    Remember the seminal moment in *Good Will Hunting*?  The therapist played by Robin Williams forcibly hugs the troubled genius played by Matt Damon.

    “It’s not your fault,” he says.

    Damon doesn’t want to hear it. He struggles, but can’t break the bear hug.

    “It’s not your fault.”

    He repeats it again. Soon Damon is sobbing. For years the horrors of his childhood have assaulted his thoughts with a simple negative lie, that it was all his fault. When confronted with a simple statement, a truthful statement, the thoughts begin to shift.

    This is the breakthrough moment in the movie when Damon’s destructive behaviors shift toward positive ones. He begins to find his way to his own more positive life.

    A positive outlook can be that powerful. Christians call it faith. Eastern religions call it energy. Psychologists call it CBT. What we call it doesn’t matter, only that we practice it.

    That’s right, as Allen Iverson once famously derided, “I’m talkin’ about practice, man. Practice.”

    Like many of these rules, being positive takes practice. We are conditioned — like rats in a maze or salivating dogs or chickens pecking a bar — to be negative. It’s ingrained deep within us because like I said at the beginning, positivity is so rare we often laugh at it when we see it.

    So it takes practice. Start by choosing people wisely. Seek out positive people. They are infectious. It rubs off, thank God. They build positivity into your day. Random acts of kindness (see rule 5: two birds with one stone, so to speak) build inner positive thoughts. Become a silver linings person. By that I mean, be slow to evaluate life events. We are so quick to judgment. This is GREAT, this is HORRIBLE. But is it? It’s like the old spiritual saying of the man who reacts to such proclamations with a simple statement: “We shall see.”

    We don’t know the big picture. We don’t have that map to our lives. It’s hard to know whether something is good or bad, so why bother with it. Just live it and watch and seek the silver linings in both. It’s amazing how your positive outlook will grow.

    Though I’ve always tried to have a fairly positive outlook on life, I never really saw its true power until the moments of utter darkness. The act of positivity in those times was an exhausting chore. My positive outlook felt like the last volunteers at the Alamo waiting for the Mexican Army to finish the siege. But I stuck with it. I wrote hundreds of times, “I am blessed.”

    My journal in those days are filled with reminders, often written in the darkest moments, that said: Be present, be productive, be positive. Life boiled down to that and I hung on to it like a toddler clutches a blanket.

    I entered rehab and nothing so depressed me as the thought I could never drink again. Week after week in AA I’d cling to the “just for the day” motto. I’d admit I couldn’t accept never being able to drink again.

    “I know I can’t drink right now,” I’d say. “I know I can’t drink for a while. When the time comes that I can drink, I hope my thoughts have changed and I don’t want to. For now, that’s enough.”

    Turns out it worked just fine. When the time of choice arrived, I went into my first restaurant and I didn’t want to drink. Soon I realized I could do without it. Time passed. My thoughts evolved. Eventually my attitudes and beliefs were radically reformed. All around me I saw the benefits of my alcohol-free life. I never took that next drink — at least not yet, I’m still going one day a time — and over time I came to appreciate my sobriety rather than resent it.

    I would have never believed that was possible, but as I learned the hard way, a positive outlook on life is that powerful.

    Try it. It’s nothing to laugh at, but soon you’ll laugh at life in a way you’ve never dreamed possible.

  title: Freeway Rick Ross rebuilds SoCal home from youth up
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The [real Rick Ross](http://www.freewayrick.com/?page_id=23) has a compelling story to tell, but it may not be the one you’d expect.

    Sure, the millions he made every day selling crack in my childhood home of Southern California is part of the story, just as is how a man who made an estimated $600 million didn’t know how to read. A huge part of the story is how the man known as Freeway Rick Ross played a role in the larger Iran-Contra Scandal that rocked the Reagan administration and sold drugs that were likely trafficked by the American government itself.

    Folks reading this story would be interested in how he sued the rap star Rick Ross for [taking his birth name](http://pitchfork.com/news/53470-rick-ross-legally-gets-to-keep-his-name-shares-bound-2-freestyle/). Freeway Rick Ross is the real Rick Ross, you best believe.


    Still part of the story is how he fought his legal case, won his freedom and is [now rebuilding the very community](http://www.freewayrick.com/?page_id=30) he once filled with drugs.

    The man’s story is packed with narrative and subplots and interesting political and cultural perspectives, which explains why he wrote a book in the first place (click [here](http://www.amazon.com/Freeway-Rick-Ross-Untold-Autobiography/dp/1499651538) to get a copy).

    But no, none of that is the story. Ricky Ross is the story of talent and how much of it is packed inside the barbed wires and bars of America’s prisons.

    “We have probably some of our best and most creative people in prison,” Freeway Rick Ross told me in a recent phone interview. “People who sell drugs are willing to risk their lives and their freedoms to accomplish a goal. These are the people we need in America to do business because they have a will that can’t be stopped.”

    That is the song and I am the choir. Having seen it firsthand, I know how we have stigmatized and demonized the men and women behind bars, and in so doing missed the enormous potential lost to drugs, poverty, and generational crime.  It’s why any true reform effort must flow from within the prisons themselves rather than be created outside of it, as I have fiercely advocated in my call for a Criminal U Reunion Conference.

    Ross couldn’t read when he was sent to prison, but he knew he could teach.  He used those skills to build an empire few have the acumen and drive to create.

    “I’ve been teaching people all my life,” he said. “My number one attribute was teaching people how to sell drugs. What I did was I taught guys how to sell drugs well, which was really teaching people how to do business. It was just a product. It could have been drugs, cars, tennis shoes.”

    So now as Ross rebuilds his post-prison life he focuses again on what he does best: teach. He wants to establish mentoring programs and has launched a slew of programs meant to increase the movement of prison reform and to give re-entering citizens a better chance of success.

    “He’s giving back, seeking no accolades for himself, just those men who are institutionalized and imprisoned in their mind,” said Madeline Coburn, an activist and spiritual counselor to inmates on death row in Missouri. “Those are the one’s he’s trying to reach if given the opportunity to help change their lives.”

    Ross wants to shatter the narrative that if you’re born poor or born black you aren’t smart or will end up in a gang. He wants others to learn what he had to teach himself, that he had skills and abilities that would help be successful in whatever he chose.

    “They are identical,” he said of the skills he’s using to build his civic-minded business now as compared to the skills he used to become a drug kingpin in Los Angeles.

    He wants others to see the potential in themselves.

    “If they intentionally make you feel dumb or stupid it don’t mean that you are,” he said. “When they see me doing the things I’m doing, they can do the same things or even greater.”

    Ross knows where he came from and the news he helped create remains part of his compelling story. It’s not often Jane Pauley and national news television dedicated 10 minutes to a story you are intricately involved in, but that’s what happened to Ross. This remains captivating news decades after it happened as it sheds light into the government’s duplicity in waging a “war on drugs” while helping to fuel the drug trade.

    But Ross says he is content to let the past be the past.

    “I don’t really harp on that much because I don’t live in the past,” he said. “I’m more of a future guy. I believe that my best days are yet to come. If I can keep chasing the past I can never to my future.”

    So he continues to build. He is involved in the music business and has a documentary project, has backed a nonprofit effort to mentor and educate others and is interested in seeing the entrepreneurial talent of felons be tapped into to create positive change.

    “I’m all over the place,” he said. “Speaking, the book, the documentary. I’m just all over the place. I just try to give folks the information that I’ve learned from my life. I believe that information is beneficial for anybody. It can help you avoid the pitfalls of life.”

    Like he said, he is at heart a teacher. Education, he believes, as we tout at Criminal U is crucial.

    “The most rebellious thing a person can do is get educated,” the rap lyrics state, as we tout here at Criminal U.

    “Exactly,” Ross says in agreement. “I’ve been doing this all my life.”

    Only now he’s directing it in a way that builds up our communities rather than the funnel the drugs that tear it down.

    That is the real story of Freeway Ricky Ross and it’s being written every day.

  title: Prison resolutions just another common tie that binds
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    It was January 2 and bitterly cold outside at 6:15 a.m. I had shrugged into my thermals and beanie and mittens with the holes in the fingers and made the trek outside to the weight pile just as I had been doing five or six times a week without fail for months. The previous few weeks had been blissfully quiet, lonely affairs outside at that hour, the night still dark and the air cold. But on this day, I had to fall in line with the new crowd of resolution-fueled inmates.

    It really pissed me off.

    I chose to work out early because it was a privilege of living in an honor dorm. The typical weight pile politics and who’s bigger than who nonsense didn’t occur at that time. I could get in, find the weights I needed and get out. Now, this little slice of personal space was being invaded. I knew it wouldn’t last. I knew they’d fall off like resolutioners always do. Still, just like those regulars at gyms all across the country on Jan. 2, I was annoyed by the influx of people trying to improve themselves.

    I wrote about it my journal:
    > “Who knew the resolutioners would be so prevalent in prison? It seems resolutioners delude themselves that willpower will suddenly erase a lifetime of undisciplined behaviors. But then again, the other crowd, the I-don’t-make-resolutions-because-they-never-last folks are also just making noise to cover up a basic lack of discipline…”

    I didn’t feel very encouraging to others that year. I had forgotten how many times I had resolved to change and did nothing about it.

    This once-a-year tired debate of resolutions and their merit speaks to a fundamental truth: We are not happy with ourselves. Whether we bash resolutions or tout them, keep them or break them, we feel a deep need for change.

    So of course the resolutioners would be prevalent in prison. Who needs change more than inmates?

    A year later I was still doing my thing each morning, still going out into the Arctic early morning cold when the next wave of resolutioners arrived as scheduled on Jan. 2. I didn’t like them much more, but a year deeper into my own change, I could empathize with them. I wrote,
    > “I head once that the definition of faith is to change. I know discipline has brought me this far. But its by faith that I found the discipline in the first place. What more can I do but keep on, and pray for the faith to see it through?”

    I try to remind myself this year that people — we’re all people, even though on the inside — share a fundamental desire to live better. Each year around this time this desire surfaces from the depths of our unconscious and becomes evident. Whether we respond to it or complain it away, we share it. It’s just one more way we are more alike than we think, we are all after the same things and together we can all make a difference.

    Happy New Year.

  title: Transformation of human spirit in Halim Flowers’ books
  author: Halim Flowers
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    On January 21, 1997, at the age of sixteen, I was charged as an adult for aiding and abetting a felony murder in the District of Columbia. During the years of 1997 and 1998, while at D.C. Jail, my experiences as a minor in an adult detention center were filmed by Blowback Productions.

    In the year of 1999, that film titled “Thug Life In D.C.” won an Emmy Award for Best Original Documentary.

    In the year of 2005, I founded SATO Communications to publish my writings. Thus far, in the decade that has ensued, I have released nine  books covering various genres.

    My personal story of transformation from being a teenage thug to an Emmy award winner, author, publisher, collegiate student and at-risk youth consultant is chronologically detailed in my memoir [Makings of a Menace, Contrition of a Man](http://www.amazon.com/Makings-MENACE-CONTRITION-Halim-Flowers/dp/1500904813). This autobiographical account vividly illustrates my trials as a juvenile adjusting to serving two life sentences in some of America’s most violent state and federal prisons, my pro se litigation legal battles that overturned three of my criminal convictions on appeal without any assistance from any attorneys, to my joys of learning that youth organizations in London, England are utilizing my at-risk youth workbooks overseas.

    My personal history as a juvenile delinquent, which I have transferred into my current juvenile justice consultancy is captured in my three books *For Young Offenders, What Our Fathers Never Told Us, and Time: How To Do It And Not Let It Do You* (all available from [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=halim+flowers)).

    *For Young Offenders* is a workbook that addresses the critical justice system issues of criminal and penal psychology, victim’s impact, and acceptance of responsibility for criminal behaviors. *What Our Fathers Never Told Us* is an excellent book not only for young boys being raised without dads but also for single mothers raising young men and fathers that have been absent from their sons’ lives. *Time* is a self-help manual for incarcerated citizens to utilize their stints in prison to develop educational empowerment and progressive pro-social skills. These books have been used effectively by Tara Libert and her FreeMinds Book club non-profit organization for at-risk and detained youth in the District of Columbia and by the parents of teenagers in Oregon, Georgia, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and London, England.

    None of my present accomplishments would be possible without the encouragement from all of the self-help literature that I have consumed during my 18 years of confinement. I have authored two books titled Mind Over Matter and Be Great Wherever You Are that demonstrate the power of the mind and the indomitable law of attraction.

    My passion and love for poetry and prose is found in my three collections of poetry titled *A Reason To Breathe, A Reason To Breathe Volume II: Til My Last Breath, and Buried Alive: Dead Men Do Talk!*

    All books can be ordered at Amazon.com. Purchases of 20 to 99 books can be ordered at wholesale price directly from the publisher at $7 per book; orders for 100 books or more have a wholesale price of $5 per book. Wholesale orders can be directed to the publisher at:

    that 96 percent of CCA stock is controlled by mutual funds, pension funds, and

    perhaps not for the better. Yes, high-salaried executives like Keller are taking
    buyouts now while they can. And yes, the New York Times is not immune to the financial
    pressures.\n\nBut when someone like Bill Keller says the political momentum has
    changed and the issue of prison reform will likely dominate the 2016 election
    cycle, then it’s safe to assume he’s right. But when he goes a step further and
    launches his own organization solely dedicated to the cause of prison reform,
    well, like I said, that’s news.\n\nIt confirms what we’ve been saying for two
    years. The Tipping Point of prison reform has arrived.\n\nListen to Keller’s precise
    explanation from an interview with another journalistic venture, [NationSwell](http://nationswell.com/marshall-project-editor-in-chief-bill-keller-wants-to-talk-about-reforming-criminal-justice-system/#ixzz3HNKc7red):\n\nQuestion:
    *Why do you believe this country needs a media outlet like [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/)
    focused exclusively on our criminal justice system?*\n\nAnswer: __Three reasons.
    First, there is a pretty broad consensus, across the political spectrum, that
    the criminal justice system is wasteful, inhumane and largely unsuccessful at
    its primary mission, which is making us safer. Second, the economic trauma of
    the media industry has meant cutbacks in the staff, space, airtime and commitment
    devoted to investigative journalism and to reporting on complicated policy issues
    like criminal justice. And, third, this feels like a moment when the conventional
    wisdom about these issues can be moved, from a lock-em-up-and-throw-away-the-key
    mentality to something more thoughtful and strategic. This opportunity is created
    in part by a surge of conservative support for reform and the coming of age of
    a generation that was not raised on high crime rates and fear-mongering.__\n\nOn
    one hand it’s an exceptional message of confidence, a potential rallying cry for
    activists who fought the obscure fight against the industrialized prison economy
    for decades. On the other hand it’s frustrating. Now suddenly so many who profited
    from the epidemic rate of incarceration — like Wall Street backers of privatized
    prisons, politicians who ran on so-called “tough-on-crime” themes and media organization
    that largely ignored the human rights violations and institutional racism that
    fueled this epidemic — are poised to again profit from it.\n\nBut Keller is exempt
    to a large extent from the above criticism. The New York Times was one of the
    few newspapers in the country that led the early stages of the fight. The New
    York Times investigation into Det. Louis Scarcella broke open the shoddy and corrupt
    police tactics used in Brooklyn to incarcerate dozens of innocents, like our own
    Antonio Yarbough. \n\nNew York Times columnists in 2012 argued the need for reform
    but pointedly said the political will for reform didn’t exist. It didn’t then,
    but does now. The money shifted. The voting block shifted. The Tipping Point arrived.\n\nSo
    Keller’s launch of a dedicated, funded, non-profit organization with journalistic
    excellence focused on the criminal justice system is not only news, it’s a stiff
    wind at the backs of prison reform advocates all across the country."

  title: Inmates have skills, need funding, to launch businesses on re-entry
  author: Halim Flowers
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Most people in prison have operated criminal enterprises while they were in society. Some offenders even ran legitimate establishments when they were in the free world.

    Many people, such as Catherine Rohr who founded Defy Ventures as an incubator for ex-offender entrepreneurs, believe that criminals possess the same mentality as corporate executives while applying their entrepreneurial and management skills in illegal endeavors.

    We are aware that the current labor market and its employers are biased towards hiring people with felon backgrounds and criminal history. Many state and local legislatures throughout America are introducing bills to remove the felon box from job applications and other regulatory obstacles. For example, many laws now prevent returning citizens from obtaining licenses to earn a living through various vocational trades that they earned certifications for while they were in prison.

    I advocate for inmates in prison to embrace the mindset of returning to society to “create jobs,” instead of only looking for employment. For many, funding is the single largest obstacle. But if they are going to join the human race and do so at full speed, they need to learn how to take the first business step.

    In a recent article published in the Wall Street Journal on May 26, 2015, professors Dr. Rebel Cole and Dr. Tatyana Sokolyk wrote about how there is a current crises amongst many entrepreneurs neglecting to apply for bank loans because they think that they will not be approved. Utilizing statistics from the Federal Reserve Surveys of Small Business Finances from the years of 1993-2003, and from the World Bank data covering 80 countries during the time span of 2006-2014, the professors averred that small companies are letting fear of rejection keep them from applying– and getting — bank loans. They found that two out of three firms need funding, yet 40% of the companies that needed credit were discouraged from even applying for it. Furthermore, it was discovered that many of those same small businesses could have gotten funding loans if they had tried.

    The article highlighted how with such a high percentage of small businesses need credit, but failing to apply for it, small businesses and entrepreneurs are leaving billions of dollars of funding on the financing table. Getting discouraged entrepreneurs to apply for loans will reduce the number of credit-constrained small firms, which would lead to faster economic growth and more jobs.

    The article also stated that startups that receive bank loans in the company’s name have a 25% probability of surviving the first three years than those small firms that get bank loans in the owner’s name. The professors further explained that bankers keep in touch with start-ups that obtain loans in the firm’s name instead of the owner’s name to ensure that the loans stay current and to provide counseling to borrowers that run into difficulties.

    I write this blog entry to illustrate how even entrepreneurs in society are not educated thoroughly about the matters of financing their enterprises. Therefore, as prisoners, we must invest our time capital into learning how to obtain financing for our business ideas. Almost 80% of the people serving time in prison say that they want to start their own business when they return to society. Nonetheless, almost none of them are certain as to how they will obtain the money and capital to operate their ventures profitably.

    Under-capitalization and a lack of debt financing is what causes most self enterprises to fail. We now know that there are “billions of dollars” out there on the table for our ventures, now lets learn how to get it the “right” way to help build the global economy.

  title: Criminal entrepreneurs are not that uncommon
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Criminal or entrepreneur? Consider for a moment the possibility
    of both.\n\nWhen I went through rehab in prison the counselors spent a lot more
    time confronting our criminal thinking than they did our addictions. I often wondered
    about that since it seemed to me that the vast majority of those in prison were
    there largely because they were addicts.\n\nWhat came first, I wondered, like
    the old chicken and egg debate.\n\nAs it turns out the debate with inmates is
    just as muddled. But the need to challenge criminal thinking was apparent, so
    the focus stayed trained on that.\n\nThe counselors often touched on a consistent
    theme: the very skills, determination, cunning, drive and ambition that spurred
    criminal behaviors could be shifted into a more “pro-social” direction.\n\nThey
    got this one right. I’ve never seen so many creative thinkers than I did in prison.
    Not in grad school, not in my career in journalism. The desperation of the situation
    for inmates spurred incredible creativity. Whether that energy went toward future
    crime or future pro-social endeavors proved the critical difference for most people
    in Criminal U. Everybody was getting an education. It just differed on career
    path — criminal or entrepreneur– that each inmate decided to major in.\n\nDuring
    the course of my enrollment at Criminal I was approach several dozen times. Some
    of those wanted to know my “hustle,” having been convicted of financial crimes.\n\n“I
    need a new game when I get out,” one inmate told me on the yard in the hushed
    tones of prison deal making. “Set me up and I’ll be sure you get your slice.”\n\nMore
    often though the approach was different. I think I listened to more ideas for
    businesses than Mark Cuban on *Shark Tank*. \n\nWhy? Because inmates know they
    have so many strikes already against them. They have to check that box on applications
    for jobs and homes that say, “Have you ever been convicted of a crime,” which
    is almost always followed by the big red stamp: “Declined.”\n\nThey have to find
    a different way. For many that means a business of their own. Hours are spent
    inside dreaming it up, despite the long odds they face.\n\nCriminal or entrepreneur?
    On the surface it sounds like a ridiculous juxtaposition. But in reality they
    aren’t that far apart. It comes down to a choice. Like love and hate, they aren’t
    on opposite ends of a line, but opposite end of circle that are precariously close
    to each other.\n\nI’ve been both criminal and entrepreneur. Often, as in love
    and hate, they overlapped. Eventually, with the help of my alcoholism and recklessness,
    they became so muddled I couldn’t tell them apart. That’s why I ended up at Criminal
    U.\n\nAs it turns out, others have been thinking about this paradigm for a long
    time. Many have begun to do great things with it. I’ve been researching these
    programs and ideas lately. I’m stunned by the depth of insight and originality
    of these potential solutions to the vast problems of mass incarceration. Over
    the next few weeks I’ll focus on many of these ideas. For now, take a spin on
    the world-wide web and visit a few:\n\nLike [The Reset Foundation](http://theresetfoundation.org/).
    This is astounding.\n\nOr this one in New York [focused on kids behind bars](http://www.mdrc.org/project/social-impact-bond-project-rikers-island#featured_content).\n\nOr
    [this one](http://www.prisonentrepreneurship.org/) that hits the nail on the head.\n\nThe
    point is simple: We already pay billions every year to incarcerate. Once inside,
    they odds are strong they’ll return. A revolving door of escalating costs and
    unfathomable human suffering (the inmates and more importantly, the victims of
    the crimes they commit) breaks the budgets, siphoning off resources from education
    and infrastructure and innovation and services. Soon, like in Oregon, we spend
    more to house an inmate than to educate a child.\n\nBut what if we started reinvesting
    in these people with a simple goal of using their basic skills, entrepreneurial
    skills, and channeling them to legitimate opportunities to re-enter society in
    a meaningful, productive way? What if we broke the revolving door and made it
    a one-way street?\n\nThe potential profit from this type of approach is staggering.
    And the models are out there, like the few I linked to above and many, many more.\n\nIt’s
    like the old native American saying, “We need to dream this all again.”\n\nLet’s
    start dreaming. We have nothing to lose that isn’t already lost."

  title: JustLeadershipUsa launches its first training cohort
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    We recently interviewed entrepreneur and prison reform advocate Glenn Martin about his ambitious program, JustLeadershipUSA. A graduate of Criminal U, Martin has spent his time post-conviction life building a wide range of skills that has led him to this point in his career, as the founder of an ambitious program called #halfby2030 that has a goal of reducing the prison population by half by the year 2030.

    JustLeadershipUSA launched officially earlier this fall, and recently announced its accepting applications for it’s initial leadership training cohort.

    > Our Leading with Conviction Training is cohort based and will train a group of 20-35 applicants committed to working together to complete the 12-month program. The curriculum alternates four weekend group-training sessions with five web-based seminars that extend over a 10-month period. During that same time participants receive individual executive coaching as well as develop and master their own capacity as leadership coaches. We provide further training by focusing their development around the essential capacities of Community Building (membership); Advocacy; and Communication/Messaging. These program elements prepare the participants to lead and sustain initiatives that respect the cultural and political particularities of their community or region and have the best chance of producing the decarceration that is our focused goal.

    The deadline to join this important training program is Dec. 17. [Click here](https://justleadershipusa.org/pages/leadership/) for more information.

    There is no silver bullet to unraveling the complicated mess of mass incarceration. An all-in, experimental, savvy, results-focused approach is needed. The only thing we know for sure is what we’ve tried hasn’t worked. During the same three decades when our prison system quadrupled and costs topped $54 billion annually, the rate of recidivism hasn’t budged. We spend more than ever to incarcerate and have little success in trying to rehabilitate.

    That’s what makes JLUSA so compelling. It’s crafted by those who have been in the system. It’s funded well by foundations and entrepreneurs who aren’t apart of the system. And it’s trying new approaches to combat a stubborn problem. It will be exciting to see their results.

    Encourage any former inmates you know to go to their site and apply. Their lives is the one thing that is sure to change.

  title: 'Federal Judge: Thousands of Innocents Plead Guilty'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "I’ve read several articles by Judge Jed Rakoff. He’s a
    rabble-rouser, a brilliant thinker and a challenger of the status quo. I wrote
    a story about him [a while back](http://bizlawnews.com/47871/federal-judge-sounds-alarm-lack-financial-crisis-convictions/)
    about him taking the government to task for its deferential treatment of those
    responsible for the economic collapse of this country’s financial institutions.\n\nHe
    called it like he saw it: The rich got a pass while the rest of us were sent to
    prison.\n\nNow he’s back again with deadly aim in his latest straight talk about
    a stark reality that everyone in this broken criminal justice system knows: Innocents
    plead guilty.\n\nRead on:\n> A prominent New York federal judge said this week
    that a broken guilty plea system is sending too many people innocent people to
    prison, coerced by the threat of long prison sentences and not enough information.\n>
    \n> U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said the modern American system in which 97
    percent of defendants plead guilty “is totally different from what the founding
    fathers had in mind.” Rakoff elaborated on his concerns during an interview with
    the New York Daily News, a month after he first raised the issue during a speech
    at the University of Southern California.\n> \n> Rakoff blamed draconian mandatory
    minimum sentences for coercing defendants into accepting plea deals, forcing defendants
    to “choose between Satan and Lucifer.” He cited estimates that between 1 and 8
    percent of those who plead guilty are actually innocent. Even if that percentage
    were just 0.5 percent, that would be 10,000 people, he tells the New York Daily
    News.\n> \n> We only know about a fraction of this population, and they are particularly
    difficult to identify, since many defendants consider their case finalized once
    they make the calculation to enter a plea. In 2013, 87 people were exonerated
    — 17 percent for false guilty pleas.\n> \n> Chris Ochoa, now exonerated, explained
    that he was coerced by a threat even greater than a mandatory minimum — capital
    punishment — if he didn’t confess. “After many hours of interrogation and threats
    I was just worn down and I told them what I wanted to hear,” he said, noting that
    he later agreed to plead guilty.\n> \n> Rakoff isn’t optimistic that mandatory
    minimum sentences will be eliminated, even if they are reformed at the federal
    level. So he is also proposing a more formal plea bargain process in which “junior
    judges” would oversee talks between prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers.
    The mini-proceeding would include a presentation of evidence and a non-binding
    recommendation from the judge. He hasn’t yet articulated a formal proposal.\n>

  title: Cops decide guilt while inmates take blame
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "When Tony Yarbough walked out of Attica for the last time
    after serving 21 years for a murder he did not commit, most everyone involved
    from the district attorney to the defense counsel to the presiding judge to Tony
    himself, knew that a terrible injustice had been reversed.\n\nMost everyone. [One
    guy](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/yarbough-wilson-guilty-slaying-insists-article-1.1609136)
    still insists a murderer has been set free.  Phillip Grimaldi, the retired cop
    who made the bust on Tony and his 15-year-old friend Shariff Wilson, insists that
    despite conclusive DNA evidence he got the right guys.\n\nThe New York Daily News
    reported,\n> “Grimaldi, who retired in 2003 after 22 years on the force, said
    Wilson was never threatened or coerced, gave up the story relatively quickly and
    continued to admit to the murder even through his last parole hearing.\n> \n>
    “Wilson has been providing conflicting accounts throughout the years, but passed
    a polygraph test a few months ago denying any involvement.”\n\nThis is why the
    proliferation of police television shows has done so much damage to the American
    justice system. Increasingly it seems that those in power actually believe the
    TV shows. Worse, Joe Public has no idea what is really going on. This particular
    horror of injustice is just one example of far too many of what goes wrong.\n\nLet’s
    break it down:\nFor starters you have a lying police officer. Don’t take my word
    for it, it’s right in the newspaper article where Grimaldi states, “I’m disappointed
    the DA’s office never contacted me,” he told the Daily News.\n\n“Prosecutors did
    consult the lead detective in the case during their review, a DA spokeswoman said,”
    the Daily News reported.\n\nThe case is over, but Grimaldi continues to lie to
    save face or more likely to protect himself as best he can from the shitstorm
    of lawsuits headed his way.\n\nAgain, refer to the original article:\n> “Yarbough
    and Wilson are contemplating bringing lawsuits against those who wronged them,
    lawyers said.”\n\nSo we have to cut Grimaldi some slack because he isn’t going
    on record now saying, “yeah, I blew it. It was late and I wanted to get home to
    watch professional wrestling that day so we sweated the kids and got a confession.
    What’s it matter, I could tell they were bad news.”\n\nRest assured he is not
    saying that or anything else that is closer to the truth than “they did it.”\n\nThe
    real problem is on TV, the cops we love to watch are above the law. They trust
    “their gut” and they “bend” the rules to get the bad guy. The cops we hate on
    TV are the “straight arrows” the “by the book” guys who are often the straight-man
    for our rebel hero, the cop who can do no wrong, yet throws the “book” out. The
    book? Well it’s the law, the very thing they are supposed to enforce.\n\nThough
    bullshit, it makes for good TV. When real cops start acting that way it also makes
    for terrible justice. Grimaldi existed in a culture of cops who broke the laws
    and a DA’s office that did as well. That’s why more than five dozen cases are
    under review in Brooklyn alone. Many many people are doing time for crimes they
    didn’t commit, probably because these cops “trusted their gut” and continue to
    claim they got it right when DNA removes all doubt they screwed the pooch.\n\nNext,
    let’s look at Wilson’s ever-changing testimony. He confessed. He recanted. He
    then confessed again. On TV, attorneys shred this type of guy, reducing him to
    a tearful confession because we knew he was lying all along.\n\nIn real life,
    this is a guy caught in the gears of a machine intent on ripping him to shreds.
    Let’s read a bit more of the Daily News here for perspective:\n> “In his last
    parole hearing in 2011, Wilson, who admitted guilt in three hearings and denied
    it in three others, was asked by an exasperated interviewer: ‘Tell me something
    you know that nobody else knows, except maybe the police,’ according to the transcript.\n>
    \n> “The inmate — who had just said, ‘It was a horrific crime committed and I
    deeply, truly, remorsefully regret that’ — struggled to answer, eventually saying
    he dumped the knife in the apartment’s garbage can.\n> \n> “The murder weapon
    was never found.”\n\nWhy on Earth would a guy who recanted his confession admit
    to a parole board he did it? Because as every single inmate knows, you aren’t
    getting free if you hold onto your innocence.\n\nIf you’ve never been there, you
    have no idea the pressure the system brings to bear to get you to admit that you
    committed the crime. Just ask Adrian Thomas who has spent five years and counting
    behind bars for a coerced confession that has been finally tossed out of court.\n\nFor
    those that complete their sentence, their parole officers want to know first and
    foremost if they admit their guilt. If they don’t, they can expect far more scrutiny
    and perhaps a whole lot worse.\n\nWilson’s behavior makes sense to those inside.
    The odds of him ever winning his freedom in court made a lottery ticket a good
    investment. He’d been waiting for two decades for exoneration. Parole looked far
    better. If he was going to get parole, he had to say he was guilty. It’s as simple
    as that.\n\nThis is the system we have. It’s a system built on plea deals, where
    guilty enough far outweighs the right to a fair trail. It’s a system that punishes
    for trial. If a person takes their case to trial and loses they will do far more
    years than if they took a deal. They will likely lose all hope for good time or
    early release or other things that could end the ordeal. It’s a hell of a gamble,
    especially when cops will lie just like Grimaldi did and even the defense attorneys
    are paid to cut deals, not defend the rights of the accused.\n\nThe average person
    reading this story probably read it with no idea what was going on. For those
    who exist in the billion-dollar boondoggle of Criminal U, it made all the sense
    in the world, which is exactly why the time for reform is long past due."

  title: A wife forgives but will the federal government?
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "The story of Kevin Gobert is one that needs to be told.
    Soon, if we can help it, he will be featured in stories that humanize the current
    political push to reduce terrible sentences that simply throw away those that
    screw up.\n\nHuman beings are not disposal, we are finding out. The system failed
    Kevin Gobert, a first-time, non-violent, drug offender who was sentenced for 20
    years. Twenty years! Kevin made mistakes, but this type of sentence is exactly
    what has led to our country’s epidemic of mass incarceration. It needs to be changed.\n\nFor
    now, let me introduce you to Kevin’s amazing wife, Stephanie Allen-Gobert, a writer
    for yourblackworld.net. And listen to her own thoughts on all that is happening
    with her during this most difficult time of her life:\n\nIn or out…This is what
    Loves About!\nBy Stephanie Allen-Gobert\n\nGrowing up like many other young girls,
    I had dreams of a fairy tale wedding, a wedding with all the trimmings: a beautiful
    white dress, huge chapel, flawless bridesmaids, a huge layered cake, ice sculptors
    of me and my new husband, caterers running and at my beckon call, my children
    and family dressed so elegant and lovely, so many family members and friends.
    I finally make it to the alter and there stands the man of my dreams, Kevin Gobert,
    my high-school sweetheart. He is smiling from ear to ear! He is so happy, this
    is a day the Lord has made…he kisses his bride (me) and we live happily ever after.\n\nSounds
    amazing huh? And I did marry the man of my dreams. But it hasn’t always been a
    fairy tale.\n\nWe’ve had our struggles and life’s ups and downs that we have conquered.
    We have many more things we are still trying to conquer.\n\nI grew up in the great
    state of Texas. I have been with my husband for about 22 years and still counting.
    We have two beautiful children, Kierra 20, who is attending school and will become
    a dentist upon graduation and JaKobe, 14, who has plans on playing in the NBA
    and becoming an engineer. I came from a pretty big family all of us were closely
    raised by a grandmother, who did not play around in regards to her grandchildren.
    My real mom died when I was eight months in a car accident and my father, who
    is deceased, suffered from a drug addiction my entire life. I met Kevin in the
    tenth grade. We have been together on and off since. Mostly on never fully off.\n\nMy
    husband has been there for me, my family, other families and his family for as
    long as I have known him. He is always kind, caring, and loving. I don’t want
    this story to be all mushy, but this is the character of who I married.\n\nHe
    is also flawed. As his wife, I have dealt with a lot of his faults and mistakes.
    No marriage is without struggles or troubles. I have had a lot of lonely and sleepless
    nights.\n\nTwo major issues have affected our marriage severely and almost caused
    a divorce. The first was finding out about years of my husband and his infidelity
    — where two children were conceived. The turmoil a woman feels when all that comes
    to light, I don’t think any man but God understands. It is very hurtful. But through
    prayer, fasting, counseling, and me just being still and listening to what God
    wanted me to do, we made it through that. I forgave my husband, but he can tell
    you, there are times I never let him forget what he did! (I’m praying on that,
    I am human…) Despite the pain, I now have two beautiful step-kids, Elijah and
    Jade.\n\nThe second major issue was my husband ended up in federal prison. I will
    never forget that day, when I heard that aggressive knock on my door.  I went
    downstairs. A swarm of law enforcement types said, “We are here to pick up Kevin
    Gobert.”\n\nHeart breaking, I was so thankful, my children were not home to see
    their father carried away in handcuffs. The mental anguish I don’t think they
    could handle. Kevin bailed out and we went through more than three years of court
    appearances, litigation, meetings, leg-monitoring meetings, monthly home visits,
    and pretrial hearings. Finally, on Oct. 2, 2012 my husband was sentenced. He was
    given 240 months!\n\nMy heart just dropped…\n\nHow could a man — so generous,
    non violent, first-time incarcerated, almost 40 years old, with letters from key
    individuals who testified on his character, his honesty, his help in crucial matters,
    a father, MY husband, a son, a brother, a friend, a man of God now, a man who
    gave to the homeless faithfully, participated in school drives for children, a
    CHANGED MAN — be given this much time!\n\nHow does a mother explain to her children,
    “Kierra, you’re 18 now, you might see your dad home when you are about 40 years
    old; JaKobe, your dad will probably miss all your high school, college and professional
    basketball games? It heart wrenching, and I know many wives, children, and families
    deal with this on a daily basis along with me and my family.\n\nSo you might ask,
    “What makes my situation different than what million of wives go through” What
    makes me so “special?” Honestly, nothing! I am just another wife who is forced
    to deal with a system that is messed up all around. But I am being obedient to
    what God just told me and put on my heart to share with the world; this is what
    He told me:\n\n> “Write. They will listen and change will come; I’m bringing Kevin
    home to you guys and it ‘ain’t’ going take no 240 months! You do what I am asking

  title: Hope remains on long road for Wajuba McDuffy
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "By all rights Wajuba McDuffy is a model prisoner.  Featured
    in a documentary about an innovative honor prison in California, McDuffy leads
    a life inside Criminal U determined to do the best he can for himself.\n\nHe spreads
    that energy to others, so much so they advocate for him when they are released.\n\nBecause
    unless something changes, McDuffy won’t be released. Not soon, possibly not ever.\n\nBut
    I’m getting ahead of myself. To  understand McDuffy’s story, you have to understand
    his family, starting with his wife, Leticia McDuffy.\n\nA mutual friend introduced
    Wajuba to Leticia more than a decade ago.\n\n“He kept saying, ‘This brotha shouldn’t
    be here! Is there something you can do to help him?’ Leticia said. “As soon as
    I heard the full details of Wajuba’s case, I knew I had to help him get out.”\n\nWajuba’s
    case has been filed with The Innocence Project. But as Leticia says, that was
    seven year ago. The process languishes. Hope is difficult, but the McDuffys are
    resolved and will not give up the pursuit of freedom and exoneration.\n\n“I sometimes
    get emotional when giving details regarding this wrongful, unjust conviction,”
    Leticia says.\n\nWajuba hails from Compton, Calif., a notorious inner city neighborhood
    in Southern California. Like many of the young kids, he joined a gang early.\n\n“He
    had been gangbanging since he was about 10 or 11 years old,” Leticia says candidly.
    \ “The older homeboys liked having him around because he was what they called
    ‘down for the hood to the fullest.'”\n\nEven young, Wajuba was big. He was bigger
    than older teens and became a sort of enforcer within the gang. A series of run-ins
    with the law ensued.\n\nIn 1995 his mother threw him a birthday party for his
    17th. His friends arrived, looking tense, but it went by without a problem.\n\nLater
    in November of that year, Wajuba rode in the car with a couple of others. As the
    sirens lit behind them they made a hasty decision for Wajuba, who was the only
    juvenile in the car and the only one not on parole to take the charge for the
    gun that was in the car.\n\n“Wajuba foolishly took this as a way to prove his
    love for the hood even more,” Leticia says. “He copped to the gun charge, did
    his time in youth authority and was released once again.”\n\nOil contamination
    had closed Wajuba’s neighborhood. Everyone he knew had been forced to relocate.\n\nBut
    Wajuba’s parole officer tracked him down and told him the ballistics from the
    gun matched the bullets used to kill a man on his birthday, June 17, 1995.\n\nWajuba
    still wouldn’t talk about whose gun it was. He was still loyal to the gang, still
    honoring the code. Someone else fingered Wajuba, despite ample witnesses saying
    he was at his own birthday party the time of the murder.\n\nWajuba was tried as
    an adult and sentenced to 25 years to life.\n\nThe more Leticia, who worked as
    an activist for at-risk youth became involved with Wajuba’s case, the more she
    became involved with Wajuba, who is now 36 having spent his entire adult life
    in prison. Eight years ago they got together, eventually marrying. In 2008 she
    launched “Operation Free Bixx” — a facebook page and effort to advocate for her
    husband (nicknamed Bixx). She remains his fierce advocate. She lobbies for him
    and creates provocative photos for online advocacy.\n\nLeticia said The Innocence
    Project sent an attorney to meet with Wajuba two years ago. Convinced of his innocence,
    they took on his case. The effort drags on. She says the real killer is known,
    but reluctance of people to talk is “at an all-time high.” She admits “hood politics,”
    which is the coin of the realm inside prisons, remains a fierce opponent of Wajuba’s
    quest for freedom. To help free him, they must turn on someone else.\n\nLeticia
    says others from the old Compton neighborhood have had cases overturned.\n\nLeticia
    uses her own T-shirt business to promote Wajuba’s innocence and raise money.\n\n“I
    already make t-shirts under my business of 15 years called ‘[Chokolate Expressions](http://skreened.com/chokolateexpressions),’
    so it was only natural,” she says.\n\nFurther, she keeps an active [change.org
    petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/release-wajuba-now-fund) seeking support
    for the effort to free her husband. \n\nLike thousands of other juveniles convicted
    to life sentences, Wajuba McDuffy is a prime candidate for release and sentencing
    modification. Like our own Halim Flowers, he has made the most difficult step
    of transformation to break away from the gang lifestyle and begin the work of
    freedom and re-entry long before the gates would ever open. But like Halim, Wajuba
    is poised to contribute once those gates finally spring open. As the tipping point
    of sentencing reform moves ahead, I eagerly await the release of men like these,
    who have fought for their own sense of self and purpose to overcome so much despair.
    It’s easy to imagine the good they will do.\n\nLend some support. Buy a T-shirt.
    Sign the petition. Let them know they are not alone. It’s a small, but important
    step in the reclamation of life that once seemed so badly lost."

  title: Spreads 101 about more than just food
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    You aren’t supposed to leave with stuff in prison. An item inside the barbed wire and bars is worth so much more than what its worth on the outside where it's simply run of the mill.

    But I confess, I snuck out a box of food when I left. I wanted to make my family and actual prison spread with the real bottom-of-the-line, cheap, processed foods that we are forced to use and pay top price for inside.

    I was like so many others that have convinced themselves that prison spreads are great. And they are… inside. Once outside, well, that gourmet cheesecake I made that guys would offer to buy for a steep price just wasn’t that special after-all.

    Try it for yourself and see by picking up a copy of our spreads recipe book, which by the way, is about far more than just food.

    For an introductory lesson to Criminal U, check out our ebook, [Spreads 101: Prison food, culture and recipes](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GS7QH06) available at Amazon.com for your electronic reader. Just $1.99.

    For those willing to help spread the word, we hope you’ll tell your friends about it to build our network for meaningful prison reform. Thanks!

  title: Reform efforts miss the point so far
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Let’s be clear: Sentencing reform and the removal of mandatory
    minimum sentencing is not prison reform. It is just, humane, critical, overdue
    and necessary to begin to heal the wounds of an era of over-incarceration that
    permeates the American culture.\n\nWe have sent people away for decades for drug
    crimes using laws set to lock up kingpins. We have not sent many kingpins away,
    but we have sent many, many drug addicts away. That’s appalling.\n\nBut the effort
    now to reduce those sentences has precious little to do with reform because A)
    it simply corrects an egregious act of injustice under the guise of justice, and
    B) it fails to take responsibility for why we did it in the first place.\n\nReform
    must start with the assessment of what is broken and that is a place no politician
    wants to go. \n\nSadly, most of those working on reform now don’t really want
    to go there either. They don’t want to piss off the institution itself (too much)
    because then funding for programs will go elsewhere. Funds won’t go to the best
    programs or most effective methods of reform. Funds will go to the most politically
    viable, most politically advantageous and the least socially disruptive, which
    is big part why the recent talk about reform amounts to very little except talk.\n\nThat’s
    why this conversation is critical, right now, as the issue of prison reform rises
    to the surface, attracting the star power of a John Legend and his [incredible
    push](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/13/john-legend-mass-incarceration_n_7053996.html)
    for reform through the newly formed Free America campaign.\n\nLegend is on a fact-finding
    mission now, according to reports. Let’s hope he digs past the talk that is on
    the surface now.\n\nLegend wants a meeting with politicians, he gets one. He has
    an incredible platform and the ability to influence. But will he settle for legislation
    that is palatable to politicians or will he push for genuine reform? Or will he
    use the passion he showed during the Oscars to demand a new way of marrying justice
    and corrections?\n\nUnlike many non-profits and start-ups and others trying to
    carve out a place in this newly forming space of reform, Legend has nothing to
    lose. He has no reason to put his influence behind anything less than significant
    reform that ends this culture of incarceration. To end it, prison officials have
    to change, politicians have to change, police have to change, prosecutors have
    to change, parole officers have to change and convicts have to change.\n\nWhat
    we have right now is nowhere near enough disruption to the cycles of crime, the
    school-to-prison pipeline and the rampant education of criminality within the
    prisons to effectively end mass incarceration. We need to disrupt, innovate and
    recreate and only with the public will driven by the likes of John Legend will
    we see the true reform our civilization deserves.\n\nYes, prison populations will
    decline the way were are headed now. We will release more people. We will invest
    a bit more in programs designed to help those people succeed. Politicians will
    say, “See, it’s working,” based on these cursory statistical changes.\n\nBut we
    haven’t seen measurable gains that say those people will, in fact, succeed. So
    when they return home to struggling communities where poverty and jobs are scarce,
    what will prevent them for committing more crime and filling the prison right
    back up?\n\nIf I were a gambler I would double-down the bet I made two years ago
    that prison reform would be the poster child of bipartisan interest in 2016. I’d
    bet by 2020 a strong anti-crime candidate will tear out an old playbook from 1980
    and be a serious contender saying “Prison reform failed! Crime is on the rise!”\n\nAnd
    the cycle will continue."

    still in prison and we only had five channels to choose from. Desperate for something
    to pass the time on Friday night I started watching it.\n\nI gave it up nearly
    as quickly deciding staring at the bunk above me beat watching that crap.\n\nAll

    not.\n\nThe reason *Blue Bloods* is especially galling is it how it plays on the
    sympathies and respect we afforded NYPD after 9-11. It touts family and honor
    and code in a way that shows a fierce morality that is somehow baked into the
    DNA of every member of the NYPD.\n\nBarf.\n\nTell that to Tony Yarbough who spent

  title: What’s the cost of justice and mercy?
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    We spend $50 billion a year on “justice.” So I ask, how much do we spend on “mercy?”

    In ancient spiritual texts that the three major religions of Christianity, Judaism and Islam all ascribe, justice and mercy are often paired together. But in our increasingly hostile, revenge-driven criminal justice system, mercy has been cleaved off from our thoughts, ambitions, and funding.

    Stop now. Think a moment. When I say mercy, did you think leniency? They are not the same thing. Read the ancient texts to see it. Mercy in the scriptures often is for those already punished justly — the exiles, the imprisoned, the broken and the sinful. These are the recipients of mercy, i.e., those that need it most.

    Commitment to both justice and mercy may find the common ground for needed reform. Changing the justice part is likely to be harder than changing the mercy part; the same people who want the justice, tend to understand the concept of “paying your debt to society.” Most people are willing to give folks a second chance. They simply don’t realize that when you serve your time, you haven’t paid your debt to society. You have only paid the interest on an exorbitant credit card.

    Reform for the most part comes on a grass roots level, thousands of well-intended folks doing their best, doing what they can to make a small difference. Programs like one reported by The Root last week, for example. Or programs we’ve highlighted before like Conviction Yoga and the Insight Prison Project.

    Collectively, they accomplish a great deal. But what if governments funneled some of that $50 billion toward these efforts to give them widespread support?

    As Michelle Alexander noted in her best-selling book [The New Jim Crow](http://www.amazon.com/New-Jim-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1595586431/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1387637872&sr=1-1&keywords=new+jim+crow+michelle+alexander), we live in an era of mass incarceration. During the last two decades inmate populations exploded The cost often came at the expense of programs designed to help re-incorporate people upon release. So while more and more people go to prison, the same number (about two-thirds) will re-offend. We’ve done nothing to lower the rate of those returning to prison.

    Do the simple math. The growth of incarcerated, non-productive, broken people the government supports continues to grow at an exponential rate. Why? Well, that’s the entire point of Criminal U.

    About the only advice my attorney gave me before I was shackled up and enrolled in Criminal U was “do all the programs you can.” At one point that might have been good advice, back in the day when there was programs and when they helped you earn good time. When I got to prison and starting asking about programs, it only revealed my ignorance.

    “Prison’s don’t teach a motherfucker how to stop what they doin’,” an inmate told me early on in my enrollment at Criminal U. “They teach you how to do it better.”

    Just a week later I met with my first “counselor” — I use the term lightly when it comes to the department of corrections — who told me point blank, “there are no programs for you.”

    This fact proved itself to be true repeatedly over the next four years. What was offered was hit and miss, with only two stable programs. Inmates could get their GED. And some few inmates of the 15,000 prison population could get into a drug treatment program that offered fewer than 200 beds. Sixty of those beds were cut while I was inside.

    Programs are the first cut. Money goes to guards and beds and food and new prisons. Inmates learn from other inmates. They get out with little support facing all types of bias and hate. Jobs are tough and low paying. Finding a place to live is incredibly hard as felons are on the one group still allowed by law to discriminate against. So what do they do? Turn to what they just learned: Crime.

    Until funds and focus funnel toward breaking that cycle, the costs of incarceration at all levels of society will increase. More joblessness, more unemployment, more government substance, more addiction, more prison beds, more clogged courts. The billion-dollar boondoggle of the department of corrections, which corrects very little, will continue.

    Mercy goes unfunded, while justice runs amok. So I ask again, how much do we spend on mercy?

  title: Re-envision 4-20 to mean freedom from police state
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    April 20th is a holiday for everyone who likes to, as the song goes, “get high, high, high.”

    I spent years as an editor in a small, artistic, liberal town where pot smoking likely outpaced happy hour. It’s a Weed kind of place. My daughter once went to her car at high school — a big bulky Suburban I bought her — and had to air it out because some unknown peers used it to get high in at lunch.

    The downtown is permanently scented with a mixture of tourists high-priced colognes and perfumes, the hippy patchouli oil all trying to cover up the ubiquitous aroma of weed.

    For that town, April 20 — and really any day at 4:20 p.m. for that matter — marked the holiday of high.

    4/20 — [for reasons](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/20/420-weed-day-marijuana-april-holiday_n_3122359.html) that are as varied as the blends of quality marijuana on display in the dispensary near you — has long stood as the underground rebellion for pot smokers. Called “pot day” or “weed day” or even “independence day” by those too stoned to care what day it is, the “holiday” has never really needed a name among those who celebrate it. It only needs a Bic to spark up.

    But as the legalization of marijuana effort gathers steam in our country and the era of prohibition almost certainly comes to an end, I’d challenge us to reclaim this day not for simply getting high but for getting free.

    I don’t like pot. It’s not my drug of choice. I guess it didn’t mix with the cocktails and wine and beer that I poured faithfully into my system every day for 20 years. I urged my kids to stay away from it having seen to many instances of its role as a gateway drug and seen too many friends simply lose themselves in the fixation of intoxication. Of course, I never recognized my own duplicity, prodding my kids to “just say no” while I said yes every night to a more “acceptable” drug.

    My kids never got into drugs despite my hypocrisy and I am thankful. Still, I value their choice and would even if they went against my wishes.

    Five years of recovery has taught me the perils of my drug like all the other drugs. It also taught me that for the most part the government should tax and regulate and stay the hell out of it.

    The war on drugs is a miserable failure and at best a way of racially targeting blacks and shoving them into prison cells, while white stoners and business executives and athletes and rock stars and teachers and police all get high, high, high just as much with few of the repercussions facing people of color. Balk if you will but these are facts, proven beyond all doubt by now. Consider just two samples from Michelle Alexander’s *The New Jim Crow*:
    - “When the War on Drugs gained full steam in the mid-1980s, prison admissions for African Americans skyrocketed, nearly quadrupling in three years, and then increasing steadily until it reached in 2000 a level more than twenty-six times the level in 1983… The number of whites admitted for drug offenses in 2000 was eight times the number admitted in 1983… Although the majority of illegal drug users and dealers nationwide are white, three-fourths of all people imprisoned for drug offenses have been black or Latino.” pg. 98
    - “The racial basis inherent in the drug war is a major reason that 1 in every 14 black men was behind bars in 2006, compared with 1 in 106 white men… One in 9 black men between the ages of twenty and thirty-five was behind bars in 2006.” pg. 100

    Pay attention today to the news stories of people getting high. It’s out of the closet today and you’ll especially see it celebrated in [states like Colorado](http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/04/10/official-420-festival-organizers-get-permit/108000/) that have led the way to legalization.

    But perhaps, set your resolve to make this day about more than smoking pot. Make it the start of a movement to curb the power of our police state and make the treatment of addiction what it should be: treatment, and not incarceration.

  title: Handful of states sets U.S. death penalty agenda
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    “I wonder what has happened to the anti-death penalty movement,” death row inmate [Reggie Clemons](https://www.aclu.org/blog/capital-punishment/justice-reggie-clemons-not-another-troy-davis) told me other day.

    It’s a question that has continued to echo through my thoughts ever since.

    At a time when the entire criminal justice system and the glaring need for sweeping reform has emerged as a political objective for conservatives and progressives alike, it would seem the death penalty would be prominent in the public spotlight.

    At a time when botched executions in 2014 have showed the barbaric, secretive, racist and perhaps even illegal policies that shape our country’s policies, it would seem the abolitionist effort would be more prominent than ever.

    At a time when Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley just commuted the last four death row inmates in the state, it would seem that the push to greatly heighten scrutiny and perhaps abolish the inhumane punishment would have significant backing across the country.

    But things aren’t what they seem.

    In truth, America continues to execute its citizens every month and efforts to speed up executions continue with the enthusiastic backing of the voting populace. In truth, despite botched drugs, secretive practices lacking oversight, glaring suffering of those being executed right before our eyes, the push to heighten executions continues with little energy to stop it.

    Why? Because an overwhelming majority of this country’s executions take place in a mere handful of states who by default drive the country’s policy on executions while an overwhelming majority of states and citizens back away from executions because of the obvious problems of inhumanity and institutional racism, not to mention the likely execution of innocent people, which is the greatest crime of all.

    Let’s deal with the most inflammatory first: We almost assuredly execute innocent people. The bedrock principle in American jurisprudence of the past 100 years is that an inmate sentenced to death has to exhaust all legal remedies to absolutely guarantee that his guilt is assured and that his crime is particularly heinous. We set a high standard of death sentences, at least in theory.

    But if 2014 proved anything its that a wave of people have been locked up for decades for crimes they didn’t commit. In New York alone we have seen good men who never committed a crime locked up, like our own Antonio Yarbough who spent 21 years in a super max facility for the murder of his mother and sister only to be exonerated in 2014. The city has dozens of such cases under review. As Tony said upon his release, “if the state of New York had a death penalty, I’d have been executed by now.”

    We’ve highlighted just a few of the exonerations that have occurred because of terribly racist police tactics that were common place through the past thirty year history of the epidemic of incarceration in this country. We know beyond a doubt that many, many citizens are behind bars for crimes they didn’t commit.

    If Reggie Clemons is to be believed, he represents one glaring example. Just five days away from being executed at one point, it took Clemons nearly a two decades to earn a judges ruling that his confession was coerced, that Clemons was beaten, that DNA evidence at the scene doesn’t match his and that the police work the night he was arrested in the infamous Chain of Rocks murders was “shoddy.” Yet Clemons remains on death row in Missouri, a zealous execution state that once tried to execute two men in one night but so botched and tortured the first man it had to call of the second. Clemons is still awaiting a retrial that seems vitally necessary in light of the recent legal findings. He remains on death row. Missouri after a brief respite is back in the killing game with executions scheduled this month.

    “It has cast a chill on this prison and everyone inside it,” Clemons told me.

    Is Clemons innocent? I couldn’t possibly know. But there is no doubt his legal options won’t be exhausted until a new trial is granted and even that hangs in limbo. We also know Clemons’ co-defendants have already been executed.

    We can rest assured we execute innocent people, which alone should be enough to spark the anti-death penalty movement into the center of the public stage.

    If that simple principle isn’t enough to spark outrage and ignite the anti-death penalty movement, the legal oddity of a mere handful of states setting the policy largely because of the political support in those states for executions demands review. Of all the problems with separate but unequal in our country, perhaps this is most glaring. The federal court system has a moral obligation to ensure that a person in Texas, Missouri, Florida, Oklahoma, Ohio has the same basic rights as a person in places like Oregon and Maryland.

    [Only ten states](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/number-executions-state-and-region-1976) have executed more than two people in the last five years and one of those, Mississippi, hasn’t executed anyone in the last two years. Yet nearly 100 people have been executed in those states with far too little accountability.

    The death penalty is too extreme and too important to the foundation of our justices system to allow such a separate but unequal process to continue. But in light of such obvious disparity, Reggie Clemons’ question continues to echo through the hall of our moral compass: Where is the anti-death penalty now?

  title: 'More jails than colleges: and therein lies the problem'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I was looking for a number: How many people are behind bars in the United States right now. It used to be about two million, but I heard some people recently talk about the decline. I wanted a number. What I found instead is a basic truth that many covering this industrialized prison economy have insisted of late: For all the talk nothing has changed. Right now, today, we have [more jails in the U.S. than colleges](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/06/the-u-s-has-more-jails-than-colleges-heres-a-map-of-where-those-prisoners-live/), according to the Washington Post:
    > To put these figures in context, we have slightly more jails and prisons in the U.S. — 5,000 plus — than we do degree-granting colleges and universities. In many parts of America, particularly the South, there are more people living in prisons than on college campuses.

    The fact remains that political talk and long dormant indifference among the media awakening creates a lot of talk, but substantive action remains evasive. For all the protests in the streets, significant talks about meaningful systemic reform is mostly absent.

    Mugambi Jouet of the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mugambi-jouet/why-2014-was-a-major-year_b_6384502.html) writes,
    > Future generations might someday remember 2014 as a major year that changed everything and nothing for American justice. Not only did the Ferguson crisis spark some of the most intense media coverage on criminal justice in years, other events also drew extensive attention last year, from botched lethal injections to the increasingly bipartisan debate over reducing America’s world record imprisonment levels. Nevertheless, few meaningful reforms appear on the horizon in 2015 notwithstanding calls for a fairer system by Barack Obama, Rand Paul, and various other political figures.

    We are funding two economic systems in this country and both get roughly the same amount of tax dollars. We have our school-to-productivity pipelines that feed graduates into higher learning and productive career opportunities. We also have school-to-prison pipelines that just as effectively funnels people into the revolving door of crime, incarceration, advanced degrees in criminalization and increased crime.

    We haven’t paid much attention to the powers that be that have slowly built fences around us much like cattle ranchers corral their livestock. We live increasingly in a decreasing world of freedom.

    The militarization of our schools is evident with police, not security but sworn police officers, on campus and enforcing laws among students with a consistent and regular presence. We are literally, with increasing regularity, shoving kids from the productivity pipelines toward the prison pipelines. So it’s no shocker than enrollment at Criminal U continues to rise despite all the talk about prison population reduction and rehabilitation.

    And that number I started out looking for. Let’s call it a whopping 2.4 million Americans behind bars. Yes, it’s still on the rise.

  title: 'The first line of response to mental illness: imprisonment'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "I wrote a news brief recently that got under my skin like
    a splinter. The news focus was on charges being dropped from first-degree murder
    to second-degree woman for a woman who drove her mini-van into the ocean with
    her three small children.\n\nAfter the sensationalist dust cleared and the facts
    of the case became known the mother, Ebony Wilkerson was clearly suffering from
    severe mental illness and paranoia stemming from domestic abuse.\n\n> A 32-year-old
    mother of three has been charged with attempted second-degree murder and related
    child abuse charges for driving her children into the Atlantic Ocean.\n> \n> Ebony
    Wilkerson of North Charleston, S.C., had previously been charged on three counts
    of attempted first-degree murder and child abuse charges following the March 4
    incident. According to the Daytona Beach-News, prosecutors refused to say why
    the charges were reduced.\n> \n> Public Defender James Purdy said in a statement
    he plans to enter not guilty pleas at Wilkerson’s arraignment Thursday. He says
    he believes evidence will show Wilkerson never intended to harm the children —
    ages 3, 9 and 10 — or herself, according to a report in The Grio.\n> \n> Wilkerson
    brought her children to Florida out of fear from her estranged husband. Her sister
    frantically tried to get her help concerned she was having mental issues that
    impaired her judgment, according to CNN.\n> \n> The sister called 911 saying Wilkerson
    was “talking about Jesus and that there’s demons in my house. I’m trying to control
    her,” the sister said, expressing worry about her sister’s three children. “…
    I’m trying to keep them safe.”\n> \n> Police caught up to Wilkerson after she
    sped away from her sister’s Daytona Beach apartment. An officer questioned her,
    reporting that “her three children sat in the Honda Odyssey’s backseat, smiling
    and seemingly calm,” CNN reported. Wilkerson explained that she feared for her
    safety, worried that her estranged husband would harm them.\n> \n> According to
    a Daytona Beach Police report, the officer believed she might have a mental illness.
    Despite these concerns a detective also at the scene said she couldn’t be held
    under a Florida law that allows for detention of people believed to be impaired
    by mental illness.\n> \n> Almost two hours later Tuesday, Wilkerson drove her
    into the ocean.\n> \n> Beachgoers helped pull the screaming children and Wilkerson
    from the surf that day.\n\nI couldn’t help but wonder why this woman was being
    charged at all. Thanks to the heroic effort of bystanders nobody was hurt. The
    police had stopped her two hours earlier and suspected mental illness but decided
    they couldn’t help.  The frantic sister couldn’t help. \nOur system failed them
    and now our response: To imprison, sending the three children to Lord only knows
    what for a home life.\n\nI was in a graduate program in psychology in the early
    1990s when mental health hospitals were being closed for lack of funding and mental
    health clinics were operating on paper-thin budgets. At the same time, unbeknownst
    to most of us, the industrialized prison system kicked into high gear raising
    the population of inmates by nearly three times in the same span that mental health
    treatment budgets were slashed.\n\nWhere did all the people who only “crime” was
    mental illness often end up? Enrolled in Criminal U.\n\nDo you recall the pilot
    that had the nervous breakdown mid-flight awhile back? Clearly this upstanding
    man suffered a traumatic break. What was our response? To charge him with crimes.\n\n>
    “[The JetBlue pilot](http://abcnews.go.com/US/hero-jetblue-passenger-put-unruly-pilot-chokehold/story?id=16013298#.T3NpscjNmEo)
    who had to be restrained by passengers was hit today with criminal charges as
    court documents reveal he ranted about Sept. 11 and yelled, “Guys, push it to
    full throttle.”\n> \n> Capt. Clayton Osbon, 49, was suspended from his duties
    today and charged with interfering with flight crew instructions. According to
    the Department of Justice, this charge could be punishable by up to 20 years in
    prison.\n> \n> The charges were accompanied by an FBI affidavit that provides
    a fresh view of what went on in the cockpit of the plane before Osbon burst into
    the plane’s cabin.”\n> \nHe ended up spending several months in jail before being
    released with restrictions. What is most stunning was the reaction of surprise
    and anger of his release, despite having suffered a psychotic episode and yet,
    like Wilkerson, harming no one.\n\nIt just goes to show that over the last two
    decades we’ve simply decided that if you are mentally ill, you are committing
    a crime.\n\nAnd what exactly does that say about us?"

  title: 'Truth be told: reform starts with clarity'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |
    Emerging from decades of indifference, we’ve set out with a Gold Rush-like race toward prison reform. Everyone suddenly wants on the bandwagon and yet the bandwagon hasn’t yet been built.

    For the last couple of months, we’ve read the nearly daily posts about the latest reform push coming from all corners of our political spectrum. Activist, social entrepreneurs, reformers, and a bevy of those committed to the cause have begun scrambling through the mosh pit seeking recognition and an invitation to the reform party.

    It’s a madhouse so far with predictable results. Lots of talk, little reform.
    So while for a better part of a week when the news headlines across the globe paid attention to President Obama’s visit inside a prison, we have remained silent. Why add to the noise? The [first sitting U.S. president](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/us/obama-el-reno-oklahoma-prison.html?_r=0) to set foot inside a system that is home to more than seven million Americans under some criminal supervision is significant. It’s political optics, to be sure, but it’s optics that could sway a shift in the effort.

    At the very least is sets a standard: Shouldn’t you see what you want to try to fix?

    The President’s message during those visits offered more nuance than many of the politicians to date, even as he held firmly to his call for drug law reform. That’s one significant part of reform, but the effort has to evolve beyond changes to drug charges.

    President Obama is more personally invested in the toll race has played in the mass incarceration of America these past two decades. His legacy initiative of My Brother’s Keeper can’t succeed without breaking the school-to-prison pipeline. This was more than a political stop. While others mill around waiting for the bandwagon to be built so they climb aboard, Obama is off with his architects building a system of reform that will change the way we view the cycle of incarceration in America.

    At least that’s the impression we get. At least that’s our hope. It remains to be seen what he will do in his last year in office, and more importantly what he will do once he leaves office.

    Until then we can only hope the truth of this system will continue to be told. This effort will come through story first, program second. For now, we’ve got the order messed up and the efforts to date reflect it.

    The power of story will be the game-changer in remaking a criminal justice system that is both just and effective. The power of story, truth telling, will help those in position to make significant changes know best how to make them. The power of story will put the corrections back in focus within the beleaguered and ineffective Department of Corrections in this county.

    We can do our level best at reform and should. We should reduce sentences rapidly and commute those who have served far too long. These are justice issues, not reform. But we do so well aware that many of those set free are ill-prepared for the tremendous task ahead. We do so knowing many will fail. We do so knowing the true work of reform remains even while our best effort at justice begins.

    Until the truth be told, the work of reform will struggle, no matter how full it is on the bandwagon in the meantime.

  title: Ferguson remains center of reform debate
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    News cycles are as driven by fads as runways in the Fashion District of New York. Where news was once the judge and jury of what was, in fact,  “news,” now the ever-present lusty pursuit of clicks, reads, social media responses and trends defines it.

    So when a Ferguson, Mo. police officer shot and killed a young man in August and riots exploded in protest, news agencies around the world jumped on it. But without more displays it would have faded from interest faster than Psy’s dance craze.

    Which is why it’s so heroic that people of Ferguson and St. Louis and activists from around the state refuse to back down. They continue to file into the streets, continue to demand justice and reform and more importantly continue to make the dog wag its tail at this important issue. As [NBC’s Brian Williams](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/michael-brown-protesters-march-ferguson-police-department-n224681) said, “…the reason for it all, enduring anger over the shooting death of Michael Brown…”

    Missouri’s issues extend beyond Ferguson police. Reggie Clemons death row watch remains a critical measure of justice and how the state supreme court will view “shoddy” police work and forced confessions.

    The [death row torture of inmates](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/05/missouri-execution-lethal-injection/13647601/) before killing them must be addressed, not simply swept under the rug. Clemons treatment in prison and several issues like listening to legal calls must be addressed. The system is badly in name of reform.

    Ferguson is the match to light it, which is why the news must not flee to the next trend, but must do its investigative job in Missouri.

    Anger lies behind the protests, but we need more than anger. We need solutions. We need reform.

    Reform is needed in every phase of our long-ignored criminal justice system. As many leaders in the reform movement have noted, the change starts at the first point of police contact. Police officers can’t be villanized, but they have to be trained to change the way they do business. They have to see their role emerge as part of the rehabilitation of people, cities and our society that has been caught up in this epidemic of mass incarceration for decades.

    The protesters chanted “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” It’s makes clear the fear that is real within those in urban communities. But we need more. We need hands up, be counted. We need more and more people to join the movement of reform.

  title: Hardships of transfer outweighed by move home
  author: Halim Flowers
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Recently I was transferred from USP Atlanta in Georgia to FCI Gilmer in West Virginia. Actually, I was snowed in FDC Oklahoma City in transit for three weeks. Any transfer is hell. You are in new cells with new people at night and cuffed up and in holding cells for hours during the day.  Also during a transfer you have no cosmetics besides the generic items that they pass out to you. I have real dry skin so I had to lubricate my eczema skin infected legs with margarine packs. It’s funny because I was walking around smelling like a buttermilk biscuit all day long. (Smile, even I can laugh at tragedy)

    When I finally caught the plane to West Virginia, we flew into New York first and landed into a snowstorm. When the plane arrived at Pittsburgh for us to catch the bus to Glennville, West Virginia (where FCI Gilmer is located at), we had to drive in a snow blizzard and icy rain through dark mountainous roads. As we were riding the radio announced that the State of West Virginia was in a State of Emergency (Ouch). I’m just glad that we did not fall off of a cliff because this area of West Virginia reminds me of the people in the movie Wrong Turn. These Hills Do Have Eyes.

    At the end of my transfer, snow-covered the mountains. The scenery is beautiful. However, we’re on modified locked down so I can not go to the commissary to purchase the items that I need because my property has not arrived at this institution yet. And, I cannot move around the compound to see the people here that I know that can extend me a hand until I can get to the store. But I was blessed to have a guy in the block with me that I had done time with at another institution. I guess after spending 18 years in prison that it is hard to go anywhere in the system and not know at least one person there.

    Today makes a month that I have been here. I love the food, the showers are spacious and clean, the water is hot, the rooms are not too small, my cellie is cool, they have free college programs here, and the staff really doesn’t bother you much. The main adjustment is learning how the institution flows, getting a job, and waiting for my property to arrive. Of course when I received my property none of my clothes were in my box so I had to buy all new sweat suits and clothes (only to receive another box with all of my clothes two weeks later after I bought all new stuff).

    I’m still unemployed but I have everything that I need. As a matter of fact, I even submitted a proposal to the administration to start my own pre-release program here to help young inmates adjust to the federal prison system and to utilize their time to effectively prepare to be “Returning Citizens” and not just ex-offenders.(The program is name TIME, an acronym for Through Intelligence Men Evolve).

    I’m only five hours away from Washington, D.C. so I am closer to my family for visits. I’m still single so, you know, if any beautiful women in the West Virginia area are reading this feel free to contact me for a date. lol.

    I know, my blog may not be best complaint about the hardships of a transfer and adjusting to a new prison. I can’t help it, I’m just wired to see the glass as half full and I grow in my optimism with every breath I take. I’m just grateful to be alive, to be here (I know, even in prison right?), and to have been able to make it safe through flying and busing through a blizzard that took other people’s lives that same day.

  title: 'Rule #19: Eschew violence'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I purposely chose an archaic, odd-sounding word like eschew to make this rule to eschew violence more memorable. As I’ve grown older, my distaste for violence has grown, especially my own capacity for it.

    As a young man I prided myself on my toughness. What stuns me though is the realization that as a middle-aged man I still do. That, by definition, is called foolish pride.

    A lack of fear developed during my wrestling career – an athletic culture steeped in violence and pain – helped me realize it also instilled certain toughness. Unlike a vast majority of people, I’d been physically challenged. I’d been pushed, I’d been hurt and I’d responded. I rarely feared the altercation.

    I felt a certain confidence that translated into a potential for violence. I told myself it was beneficial for the security of me and those I cared about.

    I believed a lie.

    First, my confidence led to overconfidence. At times when common sense suggested I back down, I’d stick my chin out, like the time I argued with four gang members, some of whom were most likely armed judging from the twitchy grabbing inside coats that occurred while we argued. It happened one evening in downtown San Francisco over a parking space. That’s not tough, it’s a death wish.

    Second, it led to outbursts of bottled rage. Not often and never physically toward those I loved. But knowing this violence is in you means it colors your thoughts especially in times of anger or fear.

    It’s become funny – a family joke – but when I angrily swerved the car to the side of the road and tried to pull my 10-year-old son from the back seat to deliver a sound spanking, he panicked, snapped the doors locked and broke into tears, saying “you need anger management.” I never wanted to scare my son again.

    Finally, so much of our interpersonal connections are tinged with violence, especially verbally since so many lack the capacity for physicality. We stab with our words with a single-minded intent to gut our opponent. The violence of words lingers far longer than a black eye.

    In college, a favorite professor allowed me to study pacifism for an entire semester – one big, long project. It changed me intellectually and politically. I marched in protest against the first Gulf War. I organized a “No-Blood for Oil” walk to church day that landed me on the news. I’ve written countless columns against American wars and harshly critical editorials against American torture. Yet only until seeing violence run amok in prison and the dehumanization that it breeds did I finally take it to heart to purge my own capacity for violence. Only then did I confront the ugliness within.

    It turned out to be harder than I thought. The deeply buried but long-standing confidence I had in my own capacity for violence helped me navigate Criminal U. But it also festered within. My thoughts became colored with the ugly hues of violence.

    It took a lot of hard work to erase those colors. It’s taking even more to ensure they don’t return. Through spiritual renewal the stubborn tendencies and foolish pride diminish. Their influence is less apparent, especially as I lose myself more and more to the inner pacifism that my old Quaker professor tried to instill in me years ago. A truly peaceful heart is hard-earned, but blessed, from the very little bit I’ve observed.

    Having seen more violence than I care to, I can’t say I’ll ever enjoy movies that glorify violence again. I cringe at violent talk, especially my own. I want to be as far from it as I possibly can be for all the days of my life. It starts and continues with a deep cold stare into my own heart.

    Rarely are things in this world black and white. Shades of grey so permeate our existence we could only be captured by an artist with charcoal in her hands. But violence is pretty dark. It is an easy thing to disavow, and a difficult thing to accomplish. All we can do is keep staring at the black within us to root it out like cancer. Too reject violence at all levels. Too eschew. May we all have signs on doors that greet people saying, “Peace to all who enter here.”

    And may we mean it.

  title: Recidivism’s relentless refusal to let go
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    To John, Charly, Michael, Ed and so many others connected loosely to us here at Criminal U: Remember Al. Let his cautionary tale help you avoid your own. Learn the life lessons needed to not end up back insider him.

    I communicated some version of this to everyone in our community this week under the heading: life lessons. But even as I did, I knew it was a faint hope at best. Experience tells me we learn poorly from the cautionary tales of others. So often we don’t get it, we don’t capture those life lessons, until it’s too late… just like Al. I know too well that recidivism rates that haven’t changed in decades will gobble up two out of three of those we try to help here at Criminal U.

    Why, I ask myself? Why can’t others learn from the mistakes of a guy like Al? I don’t know for sure, but I think we all vastly underestimate the size of the obstacles against those who re-enter society after time in prison. We underestimate the cynicism of those in the system, which is designed not to rehabilitate but to supervise. In short, we’ve lost our collective mission within the Department of Corrections and the ensuing community supervision to “correct” much less empower toward rehabilitation.

    Over the past 15 months I have spoken often — on the radio, in meetings with leaders from government, business and media, and one-on-one with activists, workers and friends — about the singular most important reason why criminal justice reform is so necessary. In more than 30 years of epidemic incarceration that quadrupled the number of Americans in prison and ramped up the cost of imprisonment past $50 billion annually, we have done virtually nothing to lower the recidivism rate.

    In short, despite spending these billions we can’t budge the telling fact that two out of three people who go to prison will commit another crime and return. So as we toss more and more millions into prison, we ensure more and more will return. The numbers and costs have nowhere to go but up, despite the fact that we have already reached the tipping point of sustainability. States are broke and can’t pay for its prisons any more.

    As Kevin Bacon said in *A Few Good Men*, “these are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.”

    But the facts fall largely on deaf ears. It’s not really the listeners fault. The facts, these statistics, the true cost of human suffering — both of wasted lives behind bars that are offered so little help to rehabilitate and to the victims of the crimes they will again perpetuate — simply doesn’t come through in these statistics. Billions, millions, decades. All these words are enormous, but collectively tied into the message of recidivism they somehow become… small.

    We read about recidivism rates often and between the clunky word and percentages that seem more like baseball stats than a portrait of the human toll and societal cost, the figures are tone-deaf and their impact meaningless.

    But lately in the lives of a few men… lesser men, I call those of us who have been educated at Criminal U because of the stigma we will wear forever … I see the corrosive impact of those stats on their faces. I hear it in their stories as they try to explain to me what went wrong when earlier it all seemed so promising. I read it in the letters and news stories and updates on Vinelink when another promising effort to reform is cut short and a new sentence is gaveled into the public record.

    Lately I seem to carry this as a weight. It’s always with me as I see those with so much promise and humanity spiral back into drugs or fall into homelessness or struggle with the dire consequences of ongoing unemployment. The slide is so often in slow-motion, like a movie with the soundtrack of warning about what’s to come playing in my ear.

    Too often I feel we’re losing this fight. For all the talk of reform, the revolving door of Criminal U continues to swirl unabated. With each return the odds of ever breaking the cycle grow that much tougher.

    Solutions exist. We have a track record of knowledge that comes from millions being released. We have a splatter painting of serious attempts to break the cycle of recidivism in various parts across the country, like the Prison Entrepreneurial Project in Texas, New Earth in California, and the lengthy track record of Prison Fellowship across the globe. We know it can be done, but we also know it won’t be until the amount of money spent locking people up is balanced against the amount of money spent rehabilitating them.

    Because hidden behind the clunky word and boring stats is a simple fact, that is undisputable, that when two out of three people behind bars return again, everybody loses, not just the latest guy or gal that is locked up.

  title: Freedom inside comes with freedom from labels
  author: Halim Flowers
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The worst and most potent form of imprisonment is the mental acceptance of the prisoner label and the substandard culture that accompanies that title. Prisoner, inmate, felon, offender, convict, some of the many titles that have been created to brand a citizen that has been duly convicted of a criminal offense. The 13th Amendment of the United States Constitution even allows the slavery of a person that has been duly convicted of a felony; therefore, add slave to the myriad of labels for those that are housed in the American penal colonies.

    But in all of these titles, none defines the men and women who carry them. Many strive for freedom inside — within the bars, within the social stigma, within ones own heart — that transcends it all.

    People will always judge you in life. They will label, each of which comes loaded with stigmas about your ethnicity, race, or economic status. However, the true and most devastating form of the carceral experience is when a person begins to accept, embrace, identify with, and believe in the prisoner label that has been placed upon them. When a prisoner forfeits their choice to view themselves as human beings that may have made an error in their decision-making that led them to commit a criminal offense but still has the qualities internal necessary to be a pro-social, humane, and productive asset to the world, and submits to being a convict or menace to society that is incorrigible to being a progressive citizen to their community, then they have placed the strongest of manacles upon their mind.

    When a prisoner has incarcerated their mind to those disparaging social labels that are utilized to stigmatize and marginalize prisoners from society and from the mainstream society when they are released from prison, then they have willingly casted themselves into a perpetual oubliette.

    As a prisoner, I have made the conscious decision to develop an internal imagery of myself that I want to project to the world. I am a publisher, author, poet, blogger, designer of fashion, accessories, and decor, mentor, educator, financial advisor, and economist. I am spiritual, a healer, an entrepreneur, an activist, and many other titles that I deem to be dynamic and progressive. I known freedom inside! I was once a criminal and impulsively violent in my reckless youth. However, I have discovered contrition through learning the ripple effects of my prior destructive behaviors, and I have clearly demonstrated my sincere remorse for my past offenses by the constructive work that I do today with youth through my books and programs.

    In life inside, and even outside, we cannot allow the opinions of others about ourselves to dictate how we feel about ourselves. Our internal dialogue about the reflection that we see in the mirror must be positive, powerful, and progressive. We cannot control how others feel about us. What we can control is how we feel about ourselves and how we choose to conduct ourselves with others. Step outside to be free inside the mind!

  title: Colombian Blood written from inside
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |
    Life on the outside hasn’t been easy for Andolian Napraja. After spending most of his adulthood and a dozen years in federal prison, Napraja released into poverty stricken streets of Detroit. A litany of problems awaited starting with the lack of a proper ID. This meant being unable to work at the job that awaited. Then problems with his housing and obviously a shortage of cash and… and… and…

    Andolian is back in jail on a parole violation. He will soon be out again with another start and restarting his life. The same problems remain, but he’s a bit wiser about the traps and bit more resolved about staying out. But all the challenges remain.

    Andolian wants to take the skills he used to build a drug dealing cartel as a teenager to build a viable business as an adult. The gap between where he will be when he gets out and where he wants to be is cavernous.

    Andolian’s first legal success toward his new life began in prison. Once out, with the help of Criminal U, he published his first novel, Colombian Blood, a book he wrote while still in prison. He has written more books and wants to keep publishing. He wants to build his brand and eventually launch a business. The step of publishing Colombian Blood will have to be followed by many many more, all moving away from the life he once lived — and still the lifestyle he knows best.

    We can help in clear and concrete ways:
    - Buy the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1517239354).
    - Share it on our social media networks and ask others to buy.
    - Write a review on Amazon to help expand the network of interested readers.
    - Go a step further and buy a copy for someone inside prison. They will relate to both the crime story and the success of an author who had the ability and drive to write a book while in prison.

    These successes are huge. It doesn’t take much for us to help an ambitious young man who has lived his whole life in the prison pipeline. We can help him find productivity pipelines that will shift his considerable talent into contributions that will benefit society.

  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    The victims of a terrible Christmas crime felt victimized again [several months later](http://www.northjersey.com/news/more-pain-for-washington-township-family-as-teen-faces-adult-trial-in-sister-s-fatal-stabbing-1.918256) when they learned the young man who killed their daughter Teia would be tried as an adult despite being only 17 years old.

    Just why that sentence seems to make no sense is what makes this story so heartbreaking and so important. That’s because their daughter’s murderer is also their son, Travis Gallo, whose case represents a quagmire — and a test — for a criminal justice system in transition. The Travis Gallo case poses the question of what is fair when nobody but the prosecutor wants a tough on crime sentence of life in prison. Hope for a careful balance of necessary protection of the public with the hope of rehabilitation drives the Gallos through this terrible odyssey.

    As a juvenile Travis Gallo faced about 25 years. He would be a reasonably young man when he got out and could enter prison with hope and focus for rehabilitation. But now tried as an adult, any hope for release is tenuous at best.

    The criminal justice system is in dire need of reform as it seeks to move past the tough on crime policies that incarcerated more than two million Americans and sent thousands of children away for the rest of their lives. The Travis Gallo case could become a hallmark in the reform effort for better or worse.

    Both Travis and Teia Gallo were adopted by New Jersey physician Robert Gallo and his wife, Terrie.  With nine biological children, the Gallos felt compelled to adopt Travis, Teia and Teia’s natural sister when they were very young. The three children, all black, grew up in the privileged white suburb where Robert Gallo lives and practices. It was a large and close family according to Dr. Gallo, right up until the day after Christmas in 2013 when Travis, who had grown increasingly angry in recent months, repeatedly stabbed his sister.

    The stunned father could barely contain his grief, telling local media reporter blasting the sensational story on an otherwise slow news cycle that “we lost two lives today.”

    Later, as the media quickly lost interest, Gallo learned it didn’t necessarily have to be that way. He and his wife refused to turn their back on Travis. They visited him regularly and helped him adapt to his new environment. They sought information from many resources as they both helped their entire family grieve Teia’s death and learned to help Travis as best they could.

    As the only victims in the case, they hoped for cooperation with the prosecutor’s office. This hope faded by April when their son was transferred to the Bergen County Jail to be tried as an adult. He now faced a life sentence despite the United States Supreme Court’s ruling that such sentences for juveniles were unjust. The Gallos unwittingly became a test case in this pivotal moment of reform.

    Instead of relying on a public defender in what could have been a workable plea deal that would have given Travis a hope, the Gallos had to hire an attorney to prepare a defense that would take into consideration Travis’ limitations, his age, his emotional problems and the fact that the victims are the ones pushing hard for leniency over tough on crime policies.

    The expenses of the case will grow, the turmoil the Gallos will endure will grow and worst case, a trial that puts them all back in the media spotlight may have to be endured if a plea deal can’t be reached.

    The entire saga has taught the Gallos how much they didn’t know, like allowing Travis to confess alone to police that night — without his parents, the benefit of an attorney or a full understanding of his Miranda rights. Gallo did what anyone would do: cooperate with police while weathering the horrible shock of murder in his home. What we don’t know about the legal system never hits home until its far too late, which is exactly how the system is designed to work. It’s the ultimate home field advantage for prosecutors and police bent on convictions above all else.

    As the awful year anniversary of the case came and went, and with it the Gallo Family celebrating its first Christmas without Teia and with Travis behind bars, hope emerged from all the sadness. The family gathered together and commemorated Teia. Dr. Gallo said upcoming conferences with the judge could lead to a reasonable resolution and sentence that would leave Travis with a distant hope for his own life.

    Christmas will likely always be tinged with memories of tragedy for the Gallo family. But what emerges from the darkest day of their collective lives will likely depend on the wheels of a criminal justice system that is built to crush rather than restore.

  title: Glenn Ford freed, but like many other’s can’t go back
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "> \"There are many ways to measure 30 years, but for Glenn
    Ford, the yardstick is simple.\n> \n> “My sons — when I left — was babies. Now
    they grown men with babies,” he said, speaking as a free man for the first time
    in nearly three decades.\n> \n> Ford, Louisiana’s longest-serving death row prisoner,
    walked free Tuesday after spending nearly 30 years behind bars for a murder he
    did not commit.\n> \n> “My mind’s going all kinds of directions, but it feels
    good,” Ford, 64, told reporters outside the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola,
    according to CNN affiliate WAFB.\"\n\nvia [Glenn Ford, on death row in Louisiana
    for 30 years, walks free – CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/11/us/louisiana-glenn-ford-freed/index.html).\n\nAgain.\n\nAnother
    man, robbed of decades of his life, finally set free. Get used to it, because
    the Tipping Point of criminal justice reform is coming. The trickle… these isolated
    drops of injustice reversed will grow as the entire system is scrutinized. The
    era of mass incarceration is coming to an end. The era of justice could turn the
    entire billion-dollar prison economy on its ear.\n\nBut lost in all of this, so
    easy to overlook, is the human aspect. These are people. These are families. These
    are men and women who have lived with the horror of being the only one who truly
    knew they were innocent while for years everyone looked at them as evil. They’ve
    been dehumanized and cast aside, watching their lives like grains of sand through
    an hourglass.\n\nWhat can you possibly say about that?\n\nI spoke this week with
    two men who can relate to Glenn Ford. The first was Tony Yarbough who was freed
    after 21 years in Attica for the triple murder of his family that he did not commit.
    Tony moved into his first place, a small basement without a bed, and we celebrated
    it as a castle. But he has been free for about 40 days. The expenses pile up.
    The stress of adapting to a life he hasn’t known remains. The challenges are enormous.
    He has to find a job. He wants to go to school. He has plans to advocate for others
    when the time is right. But right now, day to day is hard enough. Yet Tony refuses
    to give in to the bitterness.\n\nInstead he reminded me that our God has overcome
    the challenges of this world. He encouraged me to keep the faith in my life and
    in God’s plan for me.\n\nThe second man I spoke to, Reggie Clemons, remains on
    death row. His case is before the Missouri Supreme Court.  A judge has already
    ruled that Clemons was coerced, beaten and convicted with “shoddy police work.”
    Yet the state refuses to retry him. Like Tony, Reggie went inside at the age of
    19. Like Tony, he is now in his 40s. If he is telling the truth — Amnesty International
    and the NAACP believe he is — then he too, like Ford and Yarbough, has lost the
    prime of his life to injustice.\n\n“I am alone physically, but I am not alone
    mentally or spirituality,” Clemons told me. “If it wasn’t for the support I have
    and the faith, I would have gone crazy by now.”\n\nHow is it in there now, I asked
    him, knowing well the answer.\n\n“Horrible,” he said. “Horrible but blessed.”\n\nHe
    too refuses to give into the bitterness.\n\nFord was asked if he was bitter and
    he replied,\n> “Yeah, because I was locked up almost 30 years for something I
    didn’t do,” said Ford, who wore a denim shirt, a hat and dark-rimmed glasses.\n>
    \n> “Thirty years of my life, if not all of it,” he said, WAFB reported. “I can’t
    go back.”\n\nNo we can’t go back. But these men, these lives, and the many, many
    others like them, deserve a criminal justice that is just. It deserves our best
    effort of reform. We have ample evidence the system has failed many. The time
    for us to find our better selves as a democracy, as a people, as human beings
    is long since past.\n\nNo, we can’t go back, but forward, through honest reform
    that values humanity; that is just; that protects the true victims and does not
    use random revenge for “proof; that truly does value the idea guilt “beyond a
    reasonable doubt;” that focuses on restorative justice, restitution and rehabilitation;
    that uses prisons when necessary for pubic safety as they are designed; that values
    human life; that confronts the institutional racism that has plagued us; that
    brings long-ignored, and badly needed reform… we can do that. Just as assuredly
    as innocent men and women can’t get the years back, we can go forward and bring
    reform. Some might say we owe it to them.\n\nNo we can’t go back. But if the political
    will for reform grows, forward can accomplish a great deal."

  contentAboveNewsletter: "If I repeat anything, its that the Tipping Point of political
    will for prison reform is coming. What happens once we hit it will make all the
    difference, because like any genuine change in this country, it will face determined
    opposition protecting the status quo.\n\nThe status quo says this: It won’t work.
    It doesn’t matter what it is, so long as “it” is anything that doesn’t keep locking
    people up for a very long time ensuring those who profit from the industrialized
    prison economy continue to profit — at taxpayer expense.\n\nBut as I’ve highlighted
    before, there are ample models of what “it” could look like. Here’s a rather impressive
    one. Read on:\n> “On a hot September day in Southern California, a convicted felon
    clad in a heavy helmet and scuba gear dives to the bottom of a deep-water tank.
    He spends several minutes down there, removing bolts from large metal pipes, and
    communicating his progress through a radio to a dive tender and fellow inmates
    of the California Institution for Men, a state prison in Chino.\n> \n> Fifteen
    minutes elapse before the man, William Jones, emerges from the tank. This is a
    much different scenario from a decade ago, when Jones made his living through
    armed robbery. Jones wasn’t caught until he intercepted a small-business owner
    about to make a bank deposit, and was charged with a felony. “I wanted to conquer
    the world one robbery at a time,” says Jones, 30, who is from Los Angeles’ Crenshaw
    District. “My priorities were all mixed up. I had no plan for myself, for my family,
    and didn’t care about anything.”\n> \n> Now, Jones is a student at the Marine
    Technology Training Center, a state-run program that has turned felons into divers,
    welders, riggers, construction supervisors and mechanics. The program has succeeded
    in doing something the state’s department of rehabilitation as a whole has failed
    at quite miserably: consistently rehabilitating criminals. The state’s recidivism
    rate — the percentage of individuals released from prison who are incarcerated
    again within three years — is an alarming 63.7 percent (PDF). The dive program’s
    rate, by contrast, is less than 15 percent.\n\nvia [California Dive Program Trains

  title: Exonerated but still very, very far from freedom
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    When Jonathon Flemming walked into freedom after 25 years in prison for a murder he didn’t commit, I couldn’t shake what Tony Yarbough — who best knew what Flemming was going through having experienced the exact same thing two months earlier — told me that day.

    “I have one thought as I heard this,” Tony said. “We all need to unify; we need to get together … and work.”

    I can’t shake the thought, because he was exactly right. The media attention fades quickly. Most of those exonerated will return with absolutely no resources. The challenges are staggering. Anyone who has ever been enrolled for any length of time in Criminal U can tell you, the change is a minefield that has to be navigated. You never know what will set you off and blow you up.

    > “Some exonerees don’t sleep the first night or two after their release—the jolt to their bodies, and to their minds, is so profound. But after his first meal of chicken, french fries and doughnuts, and after watching some television, Ford reportedly slept well Tuesday night—slept in late, in fact. And on Wednesday, he drank his first cup of water from a real glass and used a metal spoon for the first time since 1983. There are going to be a lot of firsts for Glenn Ford now that he’s free from that tiny cell."

    via [Glenn Ford’s First Days of Freedom After 30 Years on Death Row – Andrew Cohen – The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/03/glenn-fords-first-days-of-freedom-after-30-years-on-death-row/284396/).

    The firsts, and the freedom, could overwhelm the strongest of people. I worry about those exonerated who walk into freedom. I worry about the poverty, the loss, the difficulties once the media goes away and the euphoria of freedom leaves. What remains in that time? We owe them so much.

    Tony, I think, is an exception, in that he’s keeping himself in balance. We’ve talked about the struggles. He called me stressed out when he expected some money to arrive and impulsively went out to order Cable TV to make his new house a little less lonely. He managed the financial stress that little decision caused him. He’s got a good friend who has helped him in the day-to-day better than most. His lawyers have provided critical, initial help.

    The day Tony moved into his new apartment remains a special one. He called me and told me all about, a little basement, one-bedroom, far out in Queens. To him, it was a castle, the first place he could call his own.

    “It’s been hard,” he told me. “I’ve been basically homeless. Now I can settle in.”

    He got a TV and some furniture. He got cable, even though the bill stressed him out.

    “I got like 1,000 channels up in here,” he told me enthusiastically. I still smile when I recall it.

    The he went and bought some fish and a little fish tank and I thought that was fantastic. I could relate. When I got out one of the first things I did was build a small pond in our backyard. Winter hit before I could get it stable enough for fish, but I spend a ton of time out there. I knew I needed to go get my fish soon, just like Tony did.

    Tony has a home. He has a plan. He has a mission, really. And that more than anything else is helping him with this difficult transition back to freedom.

    For the others, I can only hope. But I know this, I think Tony is right. I do think all the exonerees need to get together, because there is, indeed, work to be done.

    *For those wanting to help Tony with his transition, please donate to his lawyer via Paypal at zach@zmolaw.com (please designate it's for Tony.) We will try to post information in future posts about other exonerees and their financial needs, along with contacts who the money can be sent to should you wish to help them out.*

  title: Art fuels survival of one night gone wrong
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Julio Cesar Osorio went out for drinks one night about three years ago in central London. He ended up spending the next two-and-a-half years in prison.

    He says the assault that led to his conviction started when the doorman at the club assaulted him, not the other way around. But in the end, the doorman had the injuries and Osorio had the prison record.

    “I was assaulted by the doorman and then the doorman went inside only to come out again and tried to wrestle me to the ground. It was during that struggle that he got hurt,” Osorio says.

    He wants to make a documentary about a judicial system that allows for a person to be assaulted twice and thrown in prison to boot.

    In the meantime, he’s using a talent he honed in prison, learning to paint on recycled prison blankets.  He found an opportunity to put on an exhibit of his art, but with just a week left, needs to raise about 2,600 euros or pounds (I am a clod and readily admit I have no idea what currency England is using these days or how it translates to dollars. American egoism–and lack of travel outside the states–run amok. Apologies. Let’s say he needs some money, fast, and leave it at that!)

    This inspired exhibit shows the lengths the human spirit will go to survive and thrive in the worst possible settings under seemingly illogical and unjust situations. As Osorio says, he needed something to survive, so he turned to art to heal his emotional wounds.

    “My life was turned upside down,” he says. ” I lost my studio, my freedom and almost my place where I live (If it hadn’t been for my daughter who dealt with all my problems while I was there) and came out to spiraling debts.

    “I reached deep level of depression and stress. To make things worse, I was also awaiting a spinal operation. The date came up and lost it because the prison did not take me. To this day, three years down the line, I am still awaiting for the operation to take place.”

    Osorio has been out for six months. He’s rebuilding his life one slow block at a time, despite his limited mobility from his delayed spinal operation. Art is the one thing that has kept his hope alive, something many of us share. When I went through a six-month rehabilitation program for alcoholism, I understood how my artistic energy had been dulled by drinking. Art become my primary source of sobriety, which continues now toward its seventh year. EffinArtist.com remains a celebration of that artistic expression in all of us, and Osorio is a walking, breathing example of just that.

    “Art saved me from going insane,” he says. “So it started as a therapeutic class, but I got absorbed and focused on improving and generating work for when I  released. I wanted to put together an exhibition and try to pursue a career as a painter. I wanted to show that my time had not been wasted.”

    “My future plan is to become a full-time, recognized artist and put this experience behind knowing that I changed that negative situation into a positive outcome.”

    This exhibit can not happen without your support. The opportunity exists, but as Osorio’s kickstarter campaign details, the costs to hold the exhibit are an obstacle he needs help to overcome.

    His website chronicles more of the story and shows how talented he is. [Check it out](http://www.juliocesarts.com/). And read more. Support his [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Julio-Cesar-Osorios-Art/748080938619303). But most importantly, right now, before it’s too late, click [here and donate](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1470212968/help-us-turn-a-negative-situation-into-a-positive). Every small amount helps and if the project is not fully funded, your donation will be returned to you.

    Help one man erase the damage from one night a long time ago by discovering a new artistic path he wouldn’t have found otherwise.

  title: Family of man killed by police keep eye on Ferguson
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    A year after Irvington, New Jersey police fired a reported 15 shοts, 10 that hit and killed Abdul-Wakil Kamal, a deadly situation reminiscent of the firestorm in Ferguson, Mo.

    Kamal’s mother, father and stepmother refuse to give into violence and hate, but they continue to push for justice, elevating the conversation as recent movie teaser shows:

    Kamal’s parents are paying close attention in the hope the Ferguson case will expose the silent plight of many, many others, like their son, who have been killed by police.

    “While we do not support violence, we hope that the prosecutors in NJ take heed,” Nadida Kamal, Kamal’s stepmother wrote in a recent email. “The murder of unarmed citizens should never be deem justified.”

    In Ferguson, Police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown touching off riots and global attention. Yet the most ignored fact of this case is that it is anything but exceptional. In fact, [one 2013 study](http://www.occupy.com/article/black-man-killed-us-every-28-hours-police) found that is happens about once a day (or once every 28 hours to be exact). We know about Trayvon Martin and we likely heard about the [12-year-old in Cleveland](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/11/27/family-12-year-old-boy-would-still-be-alive-if-police-hadnt-reacted-quickly-and/) shot and killed just last week, but many incidents — far too many — barely raise an eyebrow. Abdul-Wakil Kamal could have been one of those, which is why his family is working so hard for justice.

    [According to news reports](http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/11/man_shot_during_clash_with_irvington_police_was_not_armed_made_threats_toward_officers.html), police said Kamal would not remove his hand from his pocket during a confrontation with police on the front steps of his family home (eerily similar to Wilson’s testimony that Brown had a hand in his pocket when the officer shot and killed him). Neighbors watched from a distance for a brief while, until suddenly a flurry of shοts rang out. Kamal was kιlled instantly.

    Unlike the Brown killing, police effectively exonerated the police officers who shot Kamal within hours, not months.

    “The preliminary investigation indicates the shooting was justified, but the investigation is active and ongoing, and the matter will be presented to the grand jury,” a spokesperson said.

    The family has continued to ask for a full police investigation.

    “The investigation into the death of Abdul Kamal is continuing and the matter will likely be presented to a Grand Jury within the next sixty days,” wrote Tom Fennelly, chief assistant prosecutor in an email on Aug. 18.

    Now more than 90 days later, Nadida Kamal says the case still hasn’t been presented to the grand jury.

    “We have not received a full report,” she wrote to Criminal U. “The prosecutor’s office did not meet the 60-day time frame. They did however meet with Abdul’s mother, Michele Kamal, Kathleen Witcher, of the NAACP, Lawrence Hamm, of People’s Organization for Process, earlier this month. In that meeting, Acting Prosecutor Carolyn Murray stated that the case would be presented to the grand jury in December.”

    So with a wary eye on Ferguson, Kamal and her husband Mohammed Kamal wait for answers to their son’s death.

    The day after the shooting unnamed sources leaked information favorable to police, similar again to the leaks that came leading up to the grand jury announcement in Ferguson, Mo. Kamal’s father says the leaked information doesn’t match the facts he’s learned in trying to find out what led to his son’s death.

    Mohammad Kamal says he hired a private detective and he and his wife have talked to officials in the prosecutor’s office. They question much of what they’ve been told.

    Kamal said a police officer told him that things don’t match up with the information in the papers. The officer allegedly told him the first shοt was fired mistakenly and the others followed with more shοts.

    “They assassinated him,” Kamal said. “This is the United States of America, you don’t get assassinated for violating a restraining order. They broke their own procedures and just actually shοt him down.”

    In follow-up reports the department said it can’t afford the purchase of tasers (Wilson didn’t have a taser in Ferguson either).

    Other reports said Kamal had been maced before he was shοt, a point the elder Kamal contests. He said the coroner did not find mace on his son’s body.

    What especially disturbs Kamal is that he believes his son called the police to inform them that he was going over to the house the night he was killed. There was no domestic disturbance that night, he claimed.

    “I talked to witnesses,” Kamal said. “They say Abdul was telling them ‘I called you, don’t be pointing no guns at me.’ He had a hand in his pocket, and had his phone, and mostly likely was trying to record it.”

    The Kamals organized marches, one in January that attracted hundreds of supporters and another on Mother’s Day that blocked traffic near the spot where Kamal was killed. They have also publicly supported the parents of Michael Brown, all in a way to honor and grieve the lose of their son.

    “He was raised well. He was a carpenter. He didn’t deserve to die,” Kamal said. “He had some anger issues, but you don’t get killed for domestic issues. The police are the professionals in this field. They are supposed to know how to handle this and diffuse this.”

    While the nation protests the killing of Michael Brown, the wait for answers and a hope for justice continues in New Jersey, and in places like it all across the country where too many black men are too easily killed by those sworn to protect and serve.

  title: All eyes (and riot gear) on Ferguson (and Oakland, and…)
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "Ferguson, Mo. continues to simmer like a rumbling volcano
    about to erupt. Across the country other cities brace for the hot molten of discontent
    as well.\n\nFor better or for worse, the shooting of Michael Brown is the latest
    and potentially most violent flash point between disaffected people and the increasingly
    militaristic police force in America.  For both sides this is a less than ideal
    case, too full of emotion, distortion and distrust to bring about needed consideration,
    understanding and solutions for genuine criminal justice reform.\n\nConsider the
    situation in Ferguson, as described by [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/19/us-usa-missouri-shooting-idUSKCN0J315K20141119):\n>
    A St. Louis suburb that faced weeks of sometimes violent protests following August’s
    fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white policeman remained on edge
    on Wednesday as it waited to learn if the officer would face charges.\n> \n> A
    grand jury has been meeting for nearly three months, considering whether to indict
    Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson for the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael
    Brown, an incident that laid bare long-simmering racial tensions in the mostly
    black city.\n> \n> Missouri Governor Jay Nixon on Tuesday named a panel of 16
    commissioners to develop solutions to the deep-seated socioeconomic disparities
    in and around Ferguson.\n> \n> “This commission is not focused so much on changing
    hearts as on changing behaviors and we plan to do this by pushing through very
    aggressively legislation to change the way law enforcement acts,” said Reverend
    Traci Blackmon, one of the newly named members of the Ferguson Commission.\n>
    \n> Nixon has declared a state of emergency ahead of the grand jury’s report,
    which officials said would likely come this month and that many expect to provoke
    another wave of protests.\n> \nIn Ferguson, first-time gun buyers are on the rise,
    the police have increased purchases of riot gear and militaristic weaponry, and
    storefronts are boarding up windows in a scene that could be dropped into Gaza
    and not look too different. It’s all gone very much awry.\n\nSo much so that other
    communities, like Oakland, Calif. are bracing for the impact, according to the
    [San Francisco Chronicle](http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-is-bracing-for-mayhem-in-the-wake-of-5901398.php):\n>
    Oakland is warning residents and merchants to prepare for possible riots when
    the Missouri grand jury announces its decision over whether a white Ferguson police
    officer will face charges in the shooting death of a black man.\n> \n> Oakland
    Mayor Jean Quan advised Tuesday that anyone living or working downtown should
    park in a secure, off-street location, move trash cans to a secure site, double-check
    locks and security cameras, and re-enforce doors with steel plates so they can’t
    be pried open.\n> \n> “Although we don’t anticipate problems to occur, keeping
    peace on our streets and protecting the safety of Oakland residents and businesses
    is our top priority and we will be prepared,” Quan wrote in a letter to residents
    and business owners. “We are providing this information to raise awareness about
    these events, not to alarm, and so that you may plan ahead.”\n> \n> Several groups
    plan to converge at Frank Ogawa Plaza near City Hall at 5 p.m. the day the decision
    is announced, Quan said.\n> \nIt’s likely too late to back away from this madness.
    The situation must move forward. The volcano needs to vent its building steam.
    But the question remains: Then what?\n\nFrom the first point of contact, police
    are the so-called tip of the spear of potential reform. Vilifying them won’t help.
    Ignoring their experience and frustration with repeated criminals and crime won’t
    bring solutions. But ignoring the radical incarceration and police violence within
    our borders, much of it focused grossly disproportionately on minorities, won’t
    help either.\n\nThe chants and slogans and press statements and soundbites won’t
    bring reform or cessation of the violence. They bring polarization like we’re
    watching now in Ferguson, and have seen before in Oakland, New York, Florida and
    other hot spots around the nation. They will continue to emerge until cooler heads
    and cooperative visions emerge.\n\nReform may not be newsworthy and the pictures
    may not be interesting, but the historic direction of justice in a country built
    on the principal will only be altered through such efforts that come after the
    protests and bullets and violence subside.\n\nSo again, we ask. Then what? Without
    answering this, all this will do nothing to ensure it doesn’t happen again."

  title: "‘Good cop’ author’s compelling story set amid City by the Bay"
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    During a reading on Saturday of her book, [Good Cop, Bad Daughter](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Cop-Bad-Daughter-Unlikely/dp/0988375427/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1405221314&sr=1-1&keywords=karen+lynch+good+cop+bad+daughter), author Karen Lynch captivated the folks at Barnes and Noble in Corte Madera, Calif., with stories of her tumultuous childhood in “hippy, dippy” 1970s San Francisco. She later became one of the first police women on the force in her native city.

    Lynch read from two chapters, one of her mother’s bi-polar, addictive insanity and the other of the physical and emotional demands of police academy training. She said becoming a police officer was probably part rebellion against her mother and part self-preservation. She admitted the subconscious idea of having a gun probably helped her feel that it was the one way to truly get away from her hellish childhood.

    It was a nice turnout and a pleasant way to spend a Saturday night. It’s probably not every day that a former cop and a former inmate share a pleasant chat,  but a shared love of stories and the art of writing was far more significant that our past roles. Stories have that kind of effect. They pack power. The touch emotions and build bridges. This shared experience from both sides of the bars is what can take a story and make it come to 3-D life with full high definition color.

    The power of a story well told ties us to our earliest ancestors who passed on value around campfires and sketched experiences on cave walls. We may be more sophisticated in our story telling, but the same innate, humanity affirming and culture defining need remains the same.  The power of a story still draws together disparate people with an unexpected common bond, like say, cops and robbers — both of which are needed if the true work of prison reform is going to be successful.

    Lynch’s story is a compelling one. She captures the city, an era and an important time when women like her proved they too could wear the badge and do so well.

  title: 'Q&A: Project SWAGG founder Hass Saddique'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    Everybody’s got a hustle in prison. Everybody. But that’s not always a bad thing.

    You see it all the time. Wheels are turning, grinding a squeaky wheel while they wonder what in the hell are they going to do when they get out.

    This is a breeding ground for entrepreneurs. Some will use those skills to learn how to crime better. But others will set their mind in a new direction.

    They know when they get out they’ll have felon stamped next to their name. They know the opportunities will be limited. So they focus on how to make their own opportunities. This entrepreneurial spirit is the flower that grows amid the weeds of the industrialized prison economy.

    I look for it now. When I find it, I’m usually impressed. When impressed, sometimes I find myself motivated to do more. Talking to Hass Saddique, founder of Project SWAGG, was one of those experiences. This is a guy whose hustle is helping others while building a brand that will be a job creator for those coming behind him.

    The Swagg Man was kind enough to do a little Q&A for CriminalU.

    __Tell me about your experience inside?__

    Honestly man, my experience inside inspired me. What I mean by that is I never seen myself in prison. Not long before I got into running weapons and getting caught, I was playing pro ball in Argentina and not long before that I was in college. Not long before that I was running the streets of Buffalo headed down the wrong path so it was full circle.

    Basketball saved my life. My thinking going in was I knew I had to do my time and use the time I had wisely and get my ass home. When your in the federal system you really meet the best of the best criminals “laughing,” but you also meet some genuine guys as well.

    I was a top basketball prospect on the compound so my transition was easy. My team actually lost in the championship which sucks because we should’ve won, but hey.

    For the first time people saw things in me I didn’t see in myself. What I mean by that is I was rubbing shoulders with a lawyer, a medical doctor and a politician — all white guys — which never happened to me until I was in prison. What irony, and of course I surrounded myself with some of the sharpest brothers on the compound as well.

    I worked in the infamous Lewisburg Pen. My job was very humbling and an unforgettable experience. I basically used my time to network and set my plan to produce TV, music and movies.

    __What made you shift toward becoming an entrepreneur?__

    I’ve actually always had entrepreneurial tendencies from a very young age. I had launched a product while I was on pre-trial and that product actually helped me keep cash flow during my bid. Of course it would’ve sold much more if I was home to promote it, but hey, things happen. Seeing that product make sales showed me that I had a knack to create things that can make money.

    At that point I never seen it fit to jump in the world of having a 9 to 5 and investing in another person’s dream. I feel I should invest in my dreams and aspirations. Now don’t get me wrong, things sometimes have gotten slow in my business and I might have to grab a job for a couple months.

    Another reason why I choose to be an entrepreneur is that you can make your own luck. You make the decision to get up and go hard. That’s attractive to me.

    __Like a lot of former inmates, you have a focus on social action and community service Where did that focus come from?__

    Well it didn’t start like that. I’m was producing/starring in this makeover TV show and for the finale episode I wanted to do more, so I had an idea of giving a kid with cancer a fresh start surprise. I met a kid named Jason that had leukemia and I filmed with Jason and his family for three days. And each day filming I could not sleep after each day because I felt God put me in this position. The first day I brought a pro hockey player to his home and talked to him and family about his story. Day two we took Jason and his family to the hockey game, and day three we gave Jason a bedroom swaggover.

    This experience changed my life. I felt that it’s so many stories like Jason’s that go untold and over looked. From there we re-cut that episode and renamed the series Project SWAGG. This docu-series would tell the stories of kids and families with challenges and for each family that told me their story I would attempt to help them do something EPIC. I went on to meet more kids and families and I knew this is what I wanted to do forever if possible.

    __How did you come up with the idea for your brand?
    __

    I guess the above answer tells about how this all came about. But the one thing I didn’t mention is that I had to find a way to fund all this. So I came up with a design of a PiNK ELEPHANT named LEE that would symbolize the pink elephant in the room, which is the stories that go untold and over looked. I would put this pink elephant design on t-shirt, hoodies, tanks, etc. to make money to fund each EPIC experience.

    __What advice do you have for inmates who think about what they are going to do next?__

    The advice I would give first is to believe in yourself and work hard! People are what they are and what I mean by that is some folks going to want you to do good and others are not going to like what your doing either way so you have to just stay even keeled and believe in YOU and your product or idea. Try to do the right thing in every situation. I live by this and it helps me so much. Focus. There are so many distractions out here so you have to focus and keep feeding your mind with information. Set goals and achieve them.

    The most important advice is to keep GOD first and fill the universe with positive energy all that negative shit leave that with them negative folks.

    __In the article I read you said once you got a “white” face your business took off. That completely blows of course, but anyone of us who work with organizations focused on people of color see this all too often. Tell us how you are breaking down these stereotypes? Advice for others?__

    I’m not. This is America, man. It is what it is. You have to play the game unfortunately. My advice would be to make the moves necessary to get ahead without losing yourself and integrity. You have to be smart. Those companies and rich folks are always going to underestimate you until you prove other so use that as an advantage. Go under the radar and kill ’em slowly and consistent before you know you will be a force to be reckoned with. It’s sad that is like that but if your doing something that means something, they don’t like it.

    All you have to do is take a look at the TV and listen to the radio. The shit that’s on TV like the black-targeted reality shows is hurting us as black folks. Perception is reality so if we are perceived like the cast of Love and Hip Hop then it becomes people’s reality. It’s real to them, not just entertainment. Unless it’s a balance where people can see different images of blacks then they have a choice of who to emulate. The same goes with music nothing on the radio is positive its all party drink, money, bitches/ hoes, cars, I will shoot you. The shit is crazy!! Now, true all that stuff happens in the world and people are speaking their reality, but guess what it’s other people that are speaking knowledge and its good music but that stuff doesn’t get played on the radio.

    The problem is that there is no balance.

    __What’s going on with you and your business now? Is it a struggle? How are doing? What does the future plans entail?__

    Right now I have a few things going on with my business but the most important thing for me is being here in Buffalo right now so my daughters can finish the school year. Then I’m back to Hollywood and getting back on the grind. As far as business we just cut a new sizzle reel that I’m planning to pitch to networks. Im also working on my Fall/ Winter 2014 line that I will be displaying at the Pool trade show in August. Im also working on a partnership with the Jabbawockeez to get a kid named Jordan to Vegas to meet them and attend their show at Luxor. Jordan is a 9-year-old that is in remission from leg cancer. He is one of the kids featured in our docu-series. I’m also working to get another kid from the docu-series to meet Derek Jeter before the season is out. Because of his retirement its going to be tough.

    It’s always a struggle when you don’t have a major company backing you. So the plan is to partner with a network that will give us a budget to travel and meet these kids and families tell their story and do EPIC shit!! I’m also hoping to get a big retailer on board like Target or Kohls to get our LEE the Pink ELEPHANT in the room clothing is distributed in.

    __What kind of support do you want from readers?__

    Readers should immediately go [buy some of our clothing](http://swagguniversity.com/shop/). I know some guys will be too macho to wear pink but it’s classic man. I would tell those macho guys wear it as well and if your that macho if somebody says something about them wearing pink just molly-wop them. Just kidding.

    They should wear our stuff because it has a great cause and its classic. Also share our story and video with your friends because without people sharing the information and the movement it’s consumed but not shared to others.

    __Like I said, inspiring to all of us to do more. And Criminal U is down with Lee the Pink Elephant. We will soon be rocking that. I’m clicking over about… now. Join me. __

  title: Mother’s death defending kids comes amid Oakland progress
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I can’t stop thinking about Oakland resident Chyemil Pierce. Her picture bore into my heart with a grief I don’t often feel for those I don’t know. She’s pretty, she was soon to be married and now she’s dead.

    She was by all accounts bright, successful and an example of who most of Oakland’s power center is struggling to protect. Yet when a stray bullet hit and killed her, while she was shooing her kids to safety, many of the people I recently met knew they weren’t solving the city’s crime problem fast enough.

    I thought a lot about Chyemil Pierce as I wrapped up a pair of stories for [Oakland Local](http://oaklandlocal.com/) about the progress being made in Oakland. Her’s is the type of death that media companies now will seize on, knowing the headline will draw clicks and the sensationalism will play. But just two days earlier I was in her neighborhood with Street Outreach workers who are out there night after night, visiting shooting scenes few will write about much less care about, tirelessly working to stem the violence.

    For the last few weeks I have talked to people from West Oakland, former gang members, Mayor Libby Schaaf, Police Chief Sean Whent, staff members at Oakland Unite and tireless workers like Emilio Mena and Kevin Grant. Their ability to confront the complex problems of violent crime and rehabilitation in West Oakland can be disputed but their resolve seems unassailable.

    Folks in the neighborhood are frustrated with stubborn gang violence. When a senseless murder of a third-generation Oaklander who is making a better life for herself and her kids occurs, who isn’t seized with frustration. A San Francisco Chronicle columnist [captured this frustration](http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Slain-Oakland-mom-Residents-tried-to-get-police-6129108.php), which is focused on a single house where the fight broke out and where rampant criminal activity is conducted.

    It would be easy to typecast West Oakland with this murder. It would be easy to see nothing but the crime ridden streets and inane violence and simply avoid it. But the work to change it isn’t easy and it’s worthy of mention.

    Read more about this effort at [Oakland Local here](http://oaklandlocal.com/2015/03/oaklands-ceasefire-gains-traction-with-collaboration/). Now more than ever it is important to know more than just the tragic story of one more homicide.

    Good people are fighting for their neighborhood, not just to watch it change with new residents fleeing San Francisco but to be a part of that change. Good people are at work to ensure crime continues to drop, but opportunity rises for those who live there now.

    Sure new residents are coming. Gentrification cures a lot of ills, even in West Oakland. But Schaaf says she wants to lower crime and empower the existing residents. She wants Oakland to show the rest of the Bay Area how a true resurgence can uplift its people, not just relocate them.

    This is compelling story with deep layers that include keeping people out of gangs, giving hope to those who are trying to leave crime and addiction behind and giving new opportunities from those returning from prisons and jails. It’s about community, safety, cooperation, opportunity, jobs and much more. It’s about Chyemil Price, but it’s also about what type of future her three kids will have in Oakland.

    When I was a journalist in Virginia, few stories gripped the region like the D.C. Sniper. The killer’s randomness was fear-inducing and crippling. But I never forgot a Washington Post story that came out shortly after the D.C. Sniper was captured. It chronicled every homicide in the city during that same time the D.C. sniper was on the loose. Seventeen people, if I recall correctly, were killed in D.C. during that same time. They never made the news. But every life is vitally important.  Every life matters. Every street of West Oakland matters. These stories go deeper than one stray bullet. That’s the real story that has to be told.

    It’s our job to make sure Chyemil Pierce is not lost to a 24-hour news cycle. It’s our job to make sure we learn the whole story about a lot of great people who are trying to make sure other families don’t suffer the same fate.  It’s our job to rebuild a community out of the grief of loss of wonderful people like Chyemil Pierce.

    *The family of Chyemil Pierce has set up a donation account at Wells Fargo Bank. The account number of the Chyemil Pierce Memorial Fund is 2923997700.*

  title: 'No obstacle too high: Back on the road to life'
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: "When people graduate from Criminal U, they face massive
    obstacles that block their path on the road to productivity. It’s best described
    like standing a two feet deep in the Pacific Ocean, trying to hold your ground
    while a rip tide pulls you back to see. The pressure is relentless.\n\nIt’s a
    system that produces one thing best of all: more crime. Two-thirds of those released
    from prison will return. And fully 84 percent of those under the age of 23 will
    return. Michael Gaiski is both of these. He is only 28 years old but has been
    in some form of prison, parole, jail supervision for nearly half his life.\n\nHe
    lived in foster homes and joined a gang at a young age. His anger spilled out
    in criminal actions. He was swooped up in the flow of the urban school-to-prison
    pipeline despite obvious ability, smarts and skills. He became adept at life inside
    the system and unprepared for life outside.\n\nHe knows the challenges and has
    recognized how his own behavior and attitudes has often made the struggle worse.
    He also knows he’s running out of time if he is going to break the cycle of crime
    and live a different life. He’s been preparing for that since I first met him
    in prison rehab nearly five years ago.\n\nYou may recall his haunting lyrics that
    he wrote shortly after he went back to prison, for the last time, as we say every
    time we talk about such things. Michael’s artistic creativity is a benefit to
    him in both his ongoing sobriety and his drive to find a positive role in life.\n\nFor
    the last two years through letters and calls we have spoken about little else
    other than what he would have to do to get fully free from the system of incarceration
    and to finally become a contributing member of society. He is more determined
    than I have ever known him to be.\n\nBut five days before his release, his challenges
    grew even steeper. I’ll let him tell you:\n> On Jan. 10 I was playing a pick-up
    game of basketball in the gym of the Oregon State Penitentiary. The ball was passed
    to me and I pump faked as I saw my defender closing in. As I attempted that cut-move
    I felt and heard my right knee pop. Immediately I hit the floor and couldn’t walk
    again for weeks. I tore my ACL and had a bucket tear in my medial meniscus. The
    worst part of this is that I injured myself five days before my release.\n> \n>
    I had been planning for my release for two years. I started studying nutrition
    and fitness with the goal of becoming a trainer. I want to finish my education.
    I want to make a positive difference after the years as troubled youngster when
    I made far too many mistakes.\n\nMichael has tried to make it on his own during
    this transition, but his surgery and knowing that he likely faces two more months
    before he can get a job, has pressured his resolve. The obstacle of his knee is
    a big one. He is finally asking for some help. We’d like to do what we can to
    help him, so we launched an [Indiegogo Life Campaign](https://life.indiegogo.com/fundraisers/no-obstacle-too-high-back-on-the-road-to-life/x/10410349)
    to raise $1,000 for Michael to cover his bus pass, his physical recovery and some
    needed expenses.\n\nHelp Michael help himself on this difficult road to recovery.
    A little now can truly help navigate the obstacle and push one person toward a
    better life. Every dollar goes directly to Michael for his needs."

  title: Rapping past the pain inside Criminal U
  author: Andrew Bolsinger
  contentAboveNewsletter: |-
    I got to know Michael in prison rehab. We’d work out together and run lots of miles together and do our coursework together. We built a bond that defied the gap in our age, the difference in our upbringing and the other things that would have probably kept us strangers in any place other than Criminal U.

    His is a compelling story. He is nearing release. Come October he can return to his college where he excelled in his desire to become a personal trainer. He can pursue his dreams that no longer include banging and crime. He can finish the departure from the gang life he started far too young.

    Michael has survived Criminal U by working out, his body and his mind, staying sober and by writing about his pain. He writes rap lyrics that are dark, personal and poignant. By writing past the pain, he has changed, evolved, grown. Here is one example, Michael in his own words:

    *It’s dark outside and I’m all alone
    There’s no place to go or to call my home
    These tears I hide stem from the pain inside
    Will somebody please answer me whyYou ever been broke with no place to go?

    First verse
    *Nothin to call your own when you’re all alone
    Sheaah, that describes my life
    I was thrown in the dumpster, raised in the gutter
    I’m living in pain but survivin my struggle
    And I’m all alone like the boy in the bubble
    Hand me that fuckin’ blade
    You see this fuckin’ vein
    Watch me open it up
    And release this fuckin’ pain
    It’s like I done so much wrong and I’ll never be right
    Is that why I envision death when I sleep at night?**

    Chorus
    *It’s dark outside and I’m all alone
    There’s no place to go or to call my home
    these tears I hide stem from the pain inside
    will somebody please just tell me why*

    Second verse
    *My best companion spose to be myself
    Fuh will you show me how to love myself
    Show me how to be a friend to me
    So I’m not in the mirror looking at my enemy
    It’s times like this that my soul feels empty
    And I’m waitin for the day my creator comes to get me
    How do you scare a man who’s not afraid to die?*

    *Better yet, can you revive that man if he’s dead inside?*

    *Now look through me and see where I’ve been
    Can you feel my pain as I bleed this pen?*

    *Listen to these stories of a man who lives in sin
    That’s wakin’ up daily just wishin for the end
    My heart’s turned to blackness and it’s so damn cold
    If feel like ice has taken my soul
    And the abuse of time has taken it’s toll
    Now I’m lost in this world with no direction to go.*

    Michael’s courage got him through these dark feelings. His last letter to me sounded different…the hope he once thought would never return has re-emerged. His work through the 12 steps has brought him forward to a new place.

    It’s a work in progress, he’ll tell you. In fact, I’m pretty sure he’ll write a rap lyric someday that will do just that, on the road to a different life than one he imagined when he “bled this pen.”
