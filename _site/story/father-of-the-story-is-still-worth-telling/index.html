  <p>As Father’s Day rolls around I can’t help think of my father, who above all things has been “the story” in my life.</p>

  <p>Many times he’s the teller, grandiose and exuberant. More often he is the story itself, the larger-than-life figure that cast enormous shadows over my childhood and has been a constant presence through all the phases of my adulthood.</p>

  <p>Need a story to tell? I rifle through the “Dad” files. The septuagenarian with triplets is just a tip of his enormous iceberg of stories. His massive 6′-6″, three to four c-notes of weight frame is perfect for comic emphasis. His energy for life fills so many frames of my movie track. There’s always something he has dragged up from central casting. Something within those files of memories always works for whatever the situation may call for.</p>

  <p>On this Father’s Day, here’s one of my favorites from the greatest hits track of my life. I call it “Midnight Massacre.”</p>

  <p>Happy Father’s Day, Pop!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Little did I know life had afforded me a glimpse. Even now, with the luxury of three decades of experience, I don’t begrudge the fact I missed it. The insight from the moment that night at the altar was beyond me. Such sagacious wisdom in one so young could hardly be expected from a savant, let alone a stampeding bull of a knucklehead like me. I don’t count this opportunity lost.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, my first night at the altar—with the benefit of hindsight—serves as an effective crystal ball to the arduous, circuitous, tumultuous—hell, just about any “ous” can be appropriately applied—spiritual journey that lay ahead. I look back and can see now what I could never have hoped to see then. Still, I look back at that well-intended boy, tears dribbling off his flushed, tired, chubby cheeks, and I wish I could warn him.</p>

<p>“Pay attention son,” I’d say. “It doesn’t have to be like this. It doesn’t have to be this hard.”</p>

<p>I consider this with a sigh of resignation. If I could send such a message to me way back then, I like to think that 12-year-old would listen. I believe his heart was still pliable, his ears still receptive, his desire still attuned to please. I know with even greater certainty that in just a couple of quick years such pliability would be lost. In a mere skipping stone of time across the sea of my life, by the time those around me begin to see the troubling signs, my ears had grown deaf to such well-intended guidance. Before I could (legally) drive a car I’d become fully adorned in my identity’s rebel uniform. From then on, I’d spend my time rushing headlong into life, a type of rebel yell on my lips, directly into the poised arsenal of failure prepared to drop me in my tracks.</p>

<p>“Easy or hard,” life would ask me time and time again.</p>

<p>“Hard,” I’d reply. Always hard.</p>

<p>How ironic it seems the last good chance to redirect this hell-bent course came so early, when I was far too young to pay the lesson heed. Still despite all opportunities lost, real or imagined, my night at the altar remains the opening scene, my first concrete spiritual memory of the rugged and ragged spiritual journey that continues today. The memory starts the sequence, repeated time after cruel time. Despite all else that might be true, one fact asserts itself: My first act of obedient service to the mystery we call God ended in public shame.  It would not be the last of such episodes, not in any way, not even close.</p>

<p>The DNA of Italian Catholic boys necessitates at least some consideration of the priesthood. If exceptions existed in the 1970s, when I was a child, I certainly didn’t know of them. Typically these subtle spiritual nudges (hopelessly intertwined with the more direct physical nudges of Italian mothers) come in those pre-pubescent years, Freud’s latency stage, the last great pause in a male’s insatiable thirst for the mysterious creature female, those beautifully simple dormant years where girls have cooties, your pals are demi-gods and the brotherly pursuit of Knights of the Round Table-like glory, or life among Robin’s Merry Men, seems idyllic. They come when “No girls allowed” signs are in vogue. In the absence of female’s intoxicating allure, we boys can dream noble dreams of heroism, selflessness, camaraderie and service. Uncertain of whether such jobs as knights or Merry Men still exist, priesthood provides Italian Catholic boys a tangible, practical alternative.</p>

<p>I was typical in this regard. I don’t recall making the decision to pursue the priesthood. I knew my brother had already been a Cub Scout. I knew I needed to chart my own path. I doubted the Hardy Boys had openings to join. Somehow I fell onto the idea of becoming an altar boy at St. Denis Catholic Church  How very Catholic of me. How very Italian. Though I was the brat of the family, such a dynamic spiritual calling would clearly enhance my standing. I would be the loyal son now, the holy one. I remember the day I took the enormous, dusty, white, family Bible off the shelf where it was prominently displayed and decided to read it. All of it. Starting with Genesis 1. “In the beginning…”  I remember it clearly. I don’t remember ever making it to Genesis 2.</p>

<p>Still, with great enthusiasm, I pursued my holy order. Upon being introduced to the altar boys, I met our supervisor/trainer, a black cassocked, decidedly creepy man named Mr. Lanier. He wore the working garments of a priest. Like the Phantom of the Opera, he could virtually always be found day and night lurking in the church shadows. Yet, he wasn’t a priest. Rumors abounded as to why. Speculation circulated continually among the altar boys, but one didn’t know for sure any more than we knew what his actual job was.  What we did know was Mr. Lanier was our drill sergeant, and we feared him accordingly. We knew he had dedicated himself to service of God and the church. We sensed intuitively such service didn’t come with joy. In fact, he seemed the angriest man I’d ever met. Anger and service. An odd, discordant, juxtaposition yet, surprisingly to me, one I’d come to see time and time again among God’s most ardent believers. I never have come to understand it better than I understood Mr. Lanier when I was 12.</p>

<p>Mr. Lanier performed his tasks with a permanent scowl etched across his face. We were his charges, his burden; perhaps we were his penance. He performed his tasks of training us with dour perseverance, his small eyes furtively scanning to and fro from behind thick, black spectacles. His flabby cheeks and sagging love handles, hung out of place on his otherwise thin frame, like everything else about this strange man.</p>

<p>Do I factually recall he walked with a limp and was missing a couple of fingers? Or has the myth of this odd man grown through thirty years of faded memory? I search my mind and believe both to be true of a most unlikely candidate who would become by proxy my first spiritual guide.</p>

<p>After completing my rigorous training a couple of afternoons a week, I became a full-fledged altar boy. I joined my first brotherhood, a host of cassocked-clad boys, ages 12 to 17, who knew each other not at all from outside our Sunday morning duties.  With great anticipation and trepidation I joined their ranks. Having learned the essential roles of the Mass, I was given a spot on the schedule, working in support of the priests, in front of the pew-packed church, offering the holy rituals that went back centuries. Mr. Lanier spared no words to convey that our charge was both simple and essential: serve the priests, those holy, distant, elaborately clad men we called “father,” without word, and especially without flaw. As my Dad had often commanded my brother and me whenever company came to visit, we were to be seen and not heard. Mr. Lanier enforced this command with a snarl. My father enforced it with a swat. Both scared me silly.</p>

<p>So imagine my surprise when I saw the schedule for my first Midnight Mass when Mr. Lanier posted it a couple of weeks prior to Christmas. He had chosen me as one of a dozen or so others to participate in the service widely recognized as one of the most significant of the year. Several priests took part in the impressive pageantry. A gaggle of altar boys flocked among them. Mr. Lanier even came out of the shadows to participate, shedding his workday black cassock for ornamental colored robes similar to those worn by the priests.</p>

<p>I was given the role of candle-lighter. Candle-lighters, I learned, had two specific tasks during Midnight Mass. First, me and my co-candle-lighter would light the numerous candles all over the church prior to the start of the service, which of course began precisely at midnight on Christmas morning. It was imperative, Mr. Lanier stressed, that this task be performed without lighting myself on fire. The white, frilly blouse-like coverings we’d wear over our cassocks were highly flammable, Mr. Lanier stressed. With the abundance of extra candles displayed for Midnight Mass, the odds of connecting an open flame to one flammable altar boy increased exponentially to dangerous levels. The added pressure of lighting these candles in front of a church jam-packed with celebrants combined with the scandal of a burning altar boy on Christmas had Mr. Lanier’s taut nerves strained to the breaking point.  A fully involved, engrossed three-alarm altar boy would greatly dampen the blessed atmosphere of Midnight Mass, Mr. Lanier stressed. I don’t recall him stressing much concern for the fate of an altar boy daft enough to actually set himself ablaze. Mr. Lanier’s penetrating stare never diverted from me as he explained all of this, leaving no doubt who he suspected might just be daft enough to actually immolate himself. Knowing me, I absolutely shared his suspicion. With scrunched brow, I reluctantly raised my hand. 
“You have a question Mr. Bolsinger?” he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Uh, yeah, well….no…uh…never mind.”</p>

<p>He gave his head a brief shake; his eye glasses slipped a notch down his nose. After a prolonged thought, he decided to press on. Somehow I didn’t say—for once—what was on my mind, namely “Just why in God’s name did you pick me for this job?” I have little doubt that in that moment Mr. Lanier was asking himself the very same question. Why voice the obvious, I reasoned?</p>

<p>Oh Mother of Irony, what a sneaky sprite you are. Who would have thought that this most obvious of perils would not be my undoing, but the second, supposedly innocuous task required by the candle-lighters that would set my spiritual calling ablaze? Certainly not me, nor Mr. Lanier. Looking back I can’t help but wince at yet another opportunity lost at such an early age. How many times do I see this play out in the years to come, when my spiritual quest would not surrender in defeat to the obvious frontal assaults, but the craftier, less obvious, Trojanesque operations that would flay me from within?</p>

<p>Indeed, this second task seemed so comparatively inconsequential Mr. Lanier breezed by it with just a few words of instruction.</p>

<p>“You two candle-lighters will follow the procession forward from the very back of the church and carefully light each candle at the end of every row held by a parishioner. Do I have to actually say be careful not to spill hot wax on anyone?”
He shook his head and moved on.</p>

<p>I’d seen this ritual every Midnight Mass I’d attended. The first candle in a row is lit. Then, the flame is passed down each row from one person to the next, row by row, until the whole church looks like an encore at a Bruce Springsteen concert, glowing in a  sea of tiny flames. I could handle this, I thought. Don’t spill wax on anyone. Easy enough. Or, so I thought.</p>

<p>My excitement bubbled over that Christmas Eve. We opened presents as was our family’s custom. We played raucously until it was time to get ready for Midnight Mass. I felt exalted because we had to leave for church early because of my very important role. For once my older brother would take a back seat to me.</p>

<p>My father attended Midnight Mass. This and Easter, in his mind, fulfilled his Catholic duty, especially since he wasn’t Catholic. When Dad married my mother, the daughter of devout Italian Catholic immigrants, he promised to raise his children in a proper Catholic home even if he was too stubborn to become Catholic himself.</p>

<p>Dad’s relationship to the church—much like his relationship to virtually everything he collided with in life—was far more conflicted than casual indifference. My Dad openly defied the authority of priests and church rules. His involvement with Catholics reached back to his teen years, far more intertwined than most agnostics. Though he exasperated priests, my father remained highly sympathetic.</p>

<p>Dad was just 13 when his father sent him away to a Catholic military boarding school. My grandfather wanted both discipline and opportunity for his rambunctious son, something widely missing from their home in the frontierland territory of 1950s Alaska. Of course, Dad despised the move. He rebelled when he could. He grew angry. He resisted both discipline and opportunity except for that which he chose. One such choice led him to the Catholic Church. My Dad learned that those volunteering to be an altar boy for the campus church would excuse him from much of the marching and drilling he despised. He volunteered. Nobody asked if he was actually Catholic. He wasn’t. Nevertheless, he learned the service by heart and served the priests loyally, right up to the time a visiting bishop required all altar boys say confession. My dad was stymied. He had no idea how to say confession, a required act of all Catholics from the time they hit second grade. The gig was up. The scandal of a non-Catholic altar boy earned my father weeks of extra drills and a reduction of rank. It earned plenty of red-faced heartache to the school’s hierarchy as well. My father stayed away from all but required church services from then on. 
Toward the end of the school year my father’s world fell irrevocably off its axis. My grandfather died when the float plane he piloted crashed into an Alaskan bay. The news both devastated and defined my father. He chose to remain at the school he once despised, even refusing to leave on weekends, a decision he still can’t explain though likely came in an unconscious desire to please his now departed father.</p>

<p>Awash in lonely grief, my father drew the attention of an Irish priest who ministered to the school and surrounding towns. The priest discovered my father was an accomplished altar boy. He wrangled some type of permission to have my father accompany him on his travels to area parishes in an unofficial capacity as a defacto altar boy. To whatever extent my dad’s wounds healed during those terrible days of grief, my father credits the hours spent driving around with an old, red-nosed boozy Irish priest who took the time to feel his pain. This odd pairing of broken boy and relatively discarded priest speaks as a witness to God’s creative, mysterious, healing ways. It also seared some degree of my father’s loyalty to the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Years later, my father took up an aisle seat in the pew to watch his young son follow in his unlikely footsteps as an altar boy, with pride most non-Italian, non-Catholics wouldn’t understand.</p>

<p>In the minutes before the start of Midnight Mass, I carefully and successfully lit the candles in my half of the church. I didn’t even singe a hair. As the service started I joined the priests and altar boys in an incense-filled processional, beaming with pride. It likely goes without saying that my father paid scant attention to a service he still knew largely by heart. His idle hands and wandering thoughts conspired to contort his candle into a work of art. Did anyone really expect the candle to remain unmolested in my father’s hands? Would a child if given Playdoh not instantly smash, shape and mold? I can’t help but think someone should have seen this coming. But I didn’t.</p>

<p>Dad’s work of art, he later claimed, was a snail. Upon my first glance—which came the moment our solemn assembly of priests and altar boys and Mr. Lanier awash in pageantry and incense, ushered past the pew my father sat in—I thought the once straight, innocent, white candle had been fashioned into something altogether un-snail-like. As I raised my candle to light his, my most serious, holy expression linked eyes with my father’s look of silly innocence. His eyes drifted to his candle. Mine followed. I touched my wick to what was left of his, not very snail-like candle I could envision only one thing, and like a typical 12-year-old, I lost it. A great chuckle roared from the depths of my gut at the thought of this phallus-like impostor waiting to be lit in my father’s hand. The laugh rose like rushing water only to be severely dammed up at the last moment by my clenched lips, desperately trying to block its intrusion into the holy, incensed-fumed quiet air of the church. I captured most of my reflex. The stifled laugh cracked through my body like an earthquake. My shoulders buckled. My eyes squinted. Only a tiny sound escaped, mixed with a rush of air from my lungs that slipped out before the gates of my mouth slammed shut. Nobody saw or heard anything except my father. But the escaped breath attacked, simultaneously extinguishing both my candle and my father’s, er…snail. 
Now Dad’s enormous shoulders buckled in happy mirth. My hands trembled from repressed laughter and sudden panic. I shocked the man behind my father as I reached back to relight my candle on his, the one I had just lit a moment before. He momentarily pulled back his candle as if I was trying to steal it. Undeterred, I jammed the end of my long gold candle-holder onto his candle to relight my flame.</p>

<p>I tried again to relight the renegade shape in my father’s hand. Our efforts to connect acted like polarized magnets, pushing and pulling away from each other by the unseen force of our hidden joke. My candle nervously darted and dogged in pursuit of his, which ducked and dodged because of his silent cackles that incessantly juggled his hand. I shot a worried look over my shoulder at the departing processional, now at least four rows ahead of me.</p>

<p>My Mom began to assess the situation. A confused, yet not surprised, expression covered her face. Quickly she assessed the situation and thrust her calm hand toward me, her unmolested candle ramrod straight and still. I somehow managed to light it, barely avoiding lighting my father’s beard on fire. Her candle lit, she smacked my father’s shoulder and shooed me forward. Momentarily reprieved, I zipped through the next five rows with deftness and speed. I sighed a deep breath when I pulled back in line with the processional, even with the other candle-lighter, directly behind the ram-rod straight back of gimpy Mr. Lanier. I knew Mr. Lanier’s face had contorted into a sneer. He never missed anything. I’d hear about it later, to be sure. Nevertheless I had averted a scene. Compared with lighting the church on fire, he must have felt like he’d dodged a bullet with me. I could still feel the burn of his eyes, even though he couldn’t see me. I relaxed, just a bit, knowing there would be scant evidence to convict me. The procession continued. I lit another row of candles. I glanced up. About ten rows left.</p>

<p>I sighed a small sigh of relief. And that’s when it happened. I allowed myself to replay the scene in my mind. The still stifled laugh, still desperate to escape having been thwarted in its frontal assault, opted for misdirection. The attacking chuckles rose slowly, evasively, building stealth energy like a determined team of Navy Seals. I snickered. I snarled. I convulsed just a little. Soon, I was overrun. The mixture of giggles and nervous tension proved far too intoxicating to suppress. Full laughs escaped in fits and starts, each time blowing out my candle. The more I tried to regain my composure, the more unhinged I became. Trying to light and relight the candles became nearly impossible. The laughs grew like confident demons, something apart from me, invading me with unrelenting persistence that caused consternation yet a deeply satisfying sense of joy. Soon a brown-out caused by my struggles consumed nearly three rows. The combined murmur of the crowd picked up a backdrop beat against my stifled laughs, soon joined harmonically by Mr. Lanier’s sneer. The invading sounds rose to the level of distraction with the priestly incantations. From the center of the procession, just as they began their ascent to the altar, the monsignor noticed me. I noticed him. I noticed his eyes shout toward Mr. Lanier’s, with the intensity of a cracking whip.</p>

<p>“Leave!” the old priest mouthed, barely audible.</p>

<p>Mr. Lanier’s hand grabbed my collarbone. His other hand took my candle, which he deftly handed off to another boy. In a flash, he escorted me up the altar and out, never releasing his Spock-like grip.</p>

<p>Back stage, I burst into tears.</p>

<p>The rest remains a blur. I refused to be consoled. My shame smothered me. After the service, my mother and father retrieved me. I recall tense conversation between my parents and Mr. Lanier. Perhaps the parish priest was there but I can’t recall for sure because I refused to look up from my personal lament, arms covering tear-splotched face, hunkered in a corner of shame. Eventually, my father scooped me up. We went home.</p>

<p>I never again returned to the fellowship of the altar boys.  For the first time, but not close to the last, my spiritual calling lay in twisted wreckage.</p>
