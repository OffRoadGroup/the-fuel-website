                <p class="big"><p>“Move along.”</p>

<p>Police tell homeless people these words countless times a day in the liberal “sanctuary city” of San Francisco.</p>

<p>But the 6,000 homeless people have fewer and fewer places to move along to. Homeless advocates say punishing the poor through criminalization continues to rise. In short, there is precious little sanctuary left in the city named after St. Francis of Assisi, Saint of the poor.</p>

<p>“At a time of drastic cuts to mental health, criminalization increased from 2009-2012,” a report by the Coalition on Homelessness stated.</p>

<p>The targeted legislation increases the criminalization leading to more citations, more arrests, loss of meager assets and ineligibility for social programs.</p>

<p>Let’s take a hypothetical. The various stages of it happen every day.
With escalating rates, a landlord evicts a lower class tenant–let’s call her Sarah and give her a young child as well–so they can raise the rates. Sarah trades her car for a van and moves into it. She tries to keep her job.</p>

<p>But five times in recent years the city’s transit authority has passed legislation limiting where vehicles can park. No large vehicles are allowed in industrial areas, so Sarah is cited in the middle of the night. She moves. It happens again. Police impound her vehicle. She loses her job because of coming in late and calling in sick.</p>

<p>She gives her daughter to a relative living somewhere else, and she takes to the streets. Her apartment, which became a van, is now a sleeping bag.</p>

<p>She finds a few people who treat her kindly. They offer protection from the rampant sexual violence a homeless woman faces.</p>

<p>Consider that sexual violence against homeless women has been reported as high as 90 percent. The fear she will experience is gripping.</p>

<p>Many are already traumatized when they come to the streets as domestic violence is a primary cause (as high as 40 percent) for homelessness of women and children. That trauma and violence will likely continue.</p>

<p>So Sarah’s safety is short lived. One night, while camped out, police arrive and arrest them all. They end up locked up for seven hours, processed and released. It’s not light yet. But Sarah’s sleeping bag is now evidence. She leaves cold and with nothing. She goes to the BART stop at Civic Station that is near the jail. She falls asleep in a corner where it’s slightly warm. When the morning commute begins, she is taken into custody by BART police.</p>

<p>“It’s not OK to cite, jail and arrest people who are too poor to have a place to live. We are doing that right now. The BART police are doing that. They are not processed, but they spend about 12 hours in jail. They are put in handcuffs… This is awful,” said Jennifer Freidenbach, executive director of the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness, a few months ago in a public speech.</p>

<p>This story is hypothetical, but it also closely mirrors that which happened to Julia Chang, a single mother who defied the odds by not only getting back into stable housing but housing in San Francisco. She is one of only 30 percent who lose their homes who find a way to stay in “sanctuary city.”</p>

<p>“I became homeless largely due to domestic violence, and I was pregnant at the time. I had no idea how people look at you, judging you every day,” she said in a public speaking engagement.</p>

<p>She slept in BART, “because it’s warmer.” She was arrested more than once for looking like she was asleep, she says.</p>

<p>The officer arrested me for “intent to sleep.”</p>

<p>Chang said one of the city laws prohibits lodging and items you need for lodging. If you’re sleeping on cardboard, they’ll confiscate the cardboard. Same goes with the sleeping bag.</p>

<p>“Dogs have better rights on the street than homeless because they can lie down, they can urinate,” Chang said.</p>

<p>Chang said she felt hated when she was homeless. But many believe hatred doesn’t fuel the criminalization. Hopelessness does. San Francisco has been in a time of financial boom unlike anything since the Gold Rush. But while many have grown richer, the marginalized have been priced up. Homelessness has increased. The trash on the streets, the perpetual smell of urine, the debris from those with no place to go has also increased. We assume we can’t solve homelessness because it can’t be solved.</p>

<p>This is the biggest lie of them all.</p>

<p>“We can solve this problem because we created this problem through some very poorly thought out policy decisions,” Freidenbach said.</p>

<p>Rapid cuts in the 1980s removed the safety net that had been in place since the New Deal.</p>

<p>“We never addressed that systemic cause. We never repaired our social safety net. So over time the local governments had this burden of homelessness. So they turned to the police, which led to the massive incarceration of the homeless that continues today,” Freidenbach said.</p>

<p>If we believe homeless can’t be solved, than incarceration seems viable, so much so that San Francisco’s jail is the city’s largest housing facility for the homeless, according to a recent report.</p>

<p>But we know better. We know it’s a matter of will. Global poverty is diminishing. The United Nations has set a goal to eliminate poverty by 2030. Modern innovations and the wealth created means we have unlimited potential to solve homelessness right here. More so, we have an obligation as a society to solve it. Because after all, we created it in the first place.</p>
