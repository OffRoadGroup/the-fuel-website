                <p class="big"><p>We ran into Glenn Martin in the cyber-world attracted like a magnet by the power of his message. Martin is like that Dr. Pepper commercial that talks about being uniquely one. After getting educated at Criminal U, Martin defied the odds to find both success and influence as an innovator, entrepreneur and activist for reform.</p>

<p>He started his latest organization, JustLeadershipUSA, four months ago with a serious launch set for November. The goal is equally serious: To reduce the number of people in prison by half by the year 2030 through a strategy of federal and state-specific decarceration campaigns.</p>

<p>We caught him for about 15 minutes at the end of his jam-packed 15 hour day. Of course the first thing we wanted to know — what we always want to know with former inmates — is how: How did he make the transition from inmate to the leader he is now.</p>

<p>“For me it started on the inside,” he said. “The truth is once I ended up in prison, I was immediately taken aback at the hypocrisy in the system.”</p>

<p>He spoke of common experiences we’ve all shared, like a so-called “liaison” committee that was stacked with college graduates who quickly became infuriated at the patronizing and impossible situation of trying to improve the prison inside. Been there, done that, I thought.</p>

<p>“Most ended up thrown in the box,” he said.</p>

<p>Yep, yep, can relate to that, for sure. I was once banned from Yoga for a month because I was accused of organizing a threat group. Those were the days…
Martin became a paralegal, one of the few opportunities afforded inmates to learn something beyond menial labor.</p>

<p>“This was an important part of my career because it connected with me others coming out of the system,” he said.</p>

<p>Once out, he got to work, working his way up through the ladder of various organizations dedicated to impacting the massive state of incarceration.</p>

<p>He learned the practical problems with ambitious goals within a system designed to grind those inside and those working outside to dust. Many in his line of work suffer from “fatigue,” he said, which is precisely why JustLeadershipUSA is launching with such an ambitious goal.</p>

<p>“People have carved out the battles that they are willing to fight and a lot of them are very mediocre,” he said. They focus too much  on re-entry. It’s like saying I’m going to solve cancer and end up building emergency rooms.”</p>

<p>Of central focus to Martin’s new organization is working inside to build leaders.</p>

<p>“One of the big things missing in the field is that we have not done a good job of investing in the leadership capacity of those who have been arrested,” he said. “We have not done a good job of building a base.”</p>

<p>Martin has spent a lot of years learning that those in power, the legislatures, the corrections officials, even many of the activists, “have little appetite for risk.”</p>

<p>The latest example: President Barack Obama, who is making historic changes in sentencing, but is doing so very, very carefully. Martin said the president is looking for “perfect people” to grant clemency.</p>

<p>“I appreciate the fact that he’s saying it, but because we are not having enough conversation about this system and how this system doesn’t work… we’re going to end up with what I define is marginal change,” Martin said.</p>

<p>Martin also is not sold that the argument is purely economic. While the conservatives have suddenly switched from lock ’em up and throw away the key to prison reform solely on economic terms, Martin says the moral imperative remains the stronger, more courageous argument.</p>

<p>“How far are we willing to go?” he asks. “It’s always the moral argument that ends up toward the tipping point, not the financial argument. It’s a good argument and I wouldn’t want to lose it, but its not the main point.”</p>

<p>Martin says the time for The Tipping Point is fast approaching, acknowledging both left and right agree on many of the issues of criminal justice reform.</p>

<p>“It’s the one thing they seem to have some bipartisan support for,” he said. “But it would be a lost opportunity for The Left not to realize the moral issue that can be capitalized on.”</p>

<p>Will they risk it, he wonders? So far, the political risk takers are hard to find.</p>

<p>Speaking of risk takers, Martin practices what he preaches. He’s not just pointing fingers, he’s launching an organization from the ground up in true entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

<p>“The reason I feel more entrepreneurial now,” say the man whose title is Chief Risk Taker, “… I really did lead with the intent of building the wings on the way down and it takes a certain appetite for risk to do that. That’s an entrepreneur.”</p>

<p>He says every experience dating back to his prison job as a paralegal has helped train him for this venture. Rather than shy from those things that felt foreign — like policy, he said that he had to learn in his first post-prison jobs — he dove in and learned.</p>

<p>This more than anything else may explain his current success. So many inmates are confined in coffins of insecurity they made for themselves out of fear that someone might discover how little they actually know. Bullshit is far too often the coin of the realm in Criminal U. But for those like Martin willing to learn, the potential is significant.</p>

<p>“There’s not much of a difference of the guy on Wall Street who takes a risk with a billion dollars and the guy in the hood who sees selling crack cocaine as the way to get out,” Martin said. “One is defined as legal and one is not and that makes the difference.”</p>

<p>Recognizing that difference and impacting it with leadership skills is Martin’s focus. Shaping the skills within the inmate population that exists and directing it toward legal pursuits not only takes an inmate out of the cell, but conceivably empowers them to be like Martin, a job creator willing to reach back in his life to a painful past and help others along the way.</p>

<p>But Martin also wants to change the argument that for too long has focused entirely on the disproportionate incarceration of blacks. He’s one of them. He’s been there. He knows its true. But the mass epidemic of incarceration has impacted far more than blacks. It has touched families all across America from every walk of life. That’s the way industrialized prison economies work, they don’t discriminate in their need for human fuel to keep the gears of the machine churning. When a privatized prison operator puts a clause in a contract that forces the state to guarantee 90 percent occupancy — which has happened — that state isn’t going to stop with locking up only blacks.</p>

<p>“Disproportionate is the oldest argument and it’s a weak argument that gets no traction, and I’m a black man saying it,” Martin said. “We need to talk about how it impacts families. And other issues. It’s a lost opportunity.”</p>

<p>Martin said people don’t understand that we have hundreds of thousands of  people coming home from prisons each year. The impact on communities is enormous and yet too often ignored.</p>

<p>But it won’t be for long if Martin can figure out how to build the wings of his new organization as it descends toward its November landing.</p>

<p>For those interested in joining the effort, Martin directs them to consider becoming a member.</p>

<p>“We’re looking to create the largest and most diverse network dedicated to criminal justice reform in the country,” he said.</p>

<p>Help him reach the goal. Follow him at #halfby2030 campaign.</p>

<p>And stay tuned for November.</p>
