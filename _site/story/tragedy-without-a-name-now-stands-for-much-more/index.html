  <p>Thirteen years ago I saw all the good a newsroom could do. I was part of a band of workers who gave their all to meet the needs of a scared community seeking solace in the story.</p>

  <p>It was a tragedy without a name then, as I termed in my column that went to print on the front page in that day’s special edition. It defied answers. Yet even though the better part of our natures emerged. It’s worth remembering now that 9/11 has come to stand for so much, some of it we never imagined on that day.</p>

  <p>Below is an exerpt from a book that I am currently in the final stages of finishing. I hope it helps you remember, and of course, never forget.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sept. 11, 2001 began as it always did in the newsroom. Reporters sleepily wandered in around 8 a.m., punched on their computer screens, checked emails and decided on a story or two they could pitch. The city editor would normally call the reporters over at 8:30 for the morning budget meeting. A “budget” in a newsroom is a list of coming stories. Every reporter better have something to add to it. Each day we’d stand in a circle, one by one “pitching” stories for the upcoming edition, while the city editor grilled us about the story’s merit or lack thereof. Our boss thought it was an edgy corporate leadership style to make us all stand rather than sit at the conference table behind us. We hated it. The city editor struggled to take notes standing up, while reporters squirmed like elementary students.</p>

<p>On Sept. 11 The Boss arrived at 8:15. Always neatly attired, suit and tie cover his cartoonishly thin body, with his 1950s-style hair cut slicked to one side with a perfect part, he walked through the newsroom offering his usual greetings.</p>

<p>“Morning. Morning. Good Morning,” he’d say to each person he walked past before disappearing into his office. It was his ritual, another trick from some corporate manual to show he was a man of the people or some such thing. He’d do it religiously each morning and evening when he arrived or departed. The Boss had an arsenal of these tidbits he’d employ regularly, like the whole mandatory tie thing that every reporter despised. I once showed up dressed stylishly in a sports coat and a dress-knit, round-collar black shirt on. No tie. He beckoned me to his office within the hour.</p>

<p>“At the Daily News-Record,” he said plainly, a wry smile across his lips, “men wear ties.”</p>

<p>I started to argue.</p>

<p>“I look professi..” I started to say.</p>

<p>“Ah ah aha…” he said, holding a finger up. “At the <em>Daily News-Record</em>, men wear ties.”</p>

<p>Pressing my point I pointed an accusatory finger at a Fred Flintstone clone who sat at his cluttered desk just outside the office. A glob of shaving cream was still perched in his ear and a 1970s wide plaid tie, wrapped in a strangle knot at his neck with the uneven strands hanging in disarray over his pronounced belly.</p>

<p>“So that’s acceptable but this,” I waved my hands in front of camel hair coat and black shirt, “ is not because I don’t have a tie?”</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“At the <em>Daily-News</em>…”</p>

<p>I threw my hands up and left his office to go fetch a tie, hearing his chuckle in the background. From there on out I wore ties, just like the one I wore on Sept. 11 as I sat filling in at the vacant city editor desk at the front of a the newsroom, rifling through emails as The Boss made his introductions and walked through the newsroom shooting off his “Mornings” as he walked by.</p>

<p>A short while later, I noticed we were late for the budget meeting. I poked my head in The Boss’ office.</p>

<p>“Should I gather the troops?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” he said looking up from his emails and checking his gold watch — the kind you still had to wind — that his father had given him. “It’s that time. Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>We gathered round and the budget meeting began. As one of our best reporters pitched a story about fungus in the national parks, our features editor walked around the huddle of reporters and switched on the TV behind us.</p>

<p>“Sorry to bother you, but it looks like a plane hit one of the World Trade Center towers,” the editor said.</p>

<p>The meeting paused as we all turned to watch the news. Speculation and journalistic curiosity stopped the budget meeting cold. We all turned to the TV.</p>

<p>After a couple of minutes, The Boss reluctantly reformed our circle. Despite the obvious breaking national story, we needed to get to work on our local stories. We knew nobody would care about fungus or school boards with a tower in New York on fire, but that’s why they call it the Daily Beast. It requires feeding, no matter what. A fire in New York would fill a news hole, but not the main pages in Virginia. With our collective attention divided between the task at hand and the news report on the TV, the meeting dragged on past 9 a.m. My attention had shifted entirely to the TV. I watched, not even sure what I was seeing, as a second plane hit the second tower. At that moment, all discussion about local coverage ended.</p>

<p>The publisher, – son of famed Virginia legislator Sen. Harry Byrd – our general manager and The Boss gathered in the conference room to plan our coverage. The involvement of the owner at this level hadn’t occurred in decades. While the bosses met, I decided to plan ahead. I assigned each reporter a local angle on the tragedy, formed teams of reporters and photographers to work together and called my sources in Washington, D.C. for updates. Members of the night crew started to arrive hours before they were scheduled and we discussed tentative assignments, awaiting The Boss’ final approval.</p>

<p>I called a woman I had dated briefly who worked on the Mark Warner campaign for governor. I had spent a lot of time on the campaign trail with Warner the past 18 months. I had also hung out with his staff after campaign events talking politics over drinks, decidedly off-the-record. I knew she’d tell me what was going on. She answered, her normally practiced political spin voice completely erased by obvious terror.</p>

<p>“We don’t know what’s going on Scot,” she said. I heard the tremor in her voice. “We aren’t sure whether to leave or stay.”</p>

<p>Suddenly I could hear a blast sound over the phone. She screamed into the receiver.</p>

<p>“Are you OK?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm over the clamor of the newsroom.</p>

<p>“What was that?” she yelled to others in the room.</p>

<p>I listened to make sense of the noise. I scribbled notes on a Steno pad of everything I heard in the background. The Warner Campaign headquarters were within a stone’s throw from the Pentagon. After about thirty seconds of chaos, she realized she still held a phone in her hand.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry Scot, I’ve never been so scared,” she said.</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“They don’t know. They think it was the sonic boom of military planes taking off. I better go…”</p>

<p>I made her promise to call me later and assure me she was safe. I also wanted information I could attribute to sources close to the Pentagon, literally in this case. Even at a time like this, even when someone I considered a friend was in danger, the breaking news story remained foremost in my mind. It was hard-wired into me by this point.</p>

<p>By 10:30 a.m., with news of another plane down in Pennsylvania and another crash at the Pentagon, the bosses decided to publish our first afternoon special edition since the attack on Pearl Harbor sixty years prior. The Boss returned to the newsroom with the approval for the special edition. I handed him my budget for our comprehensive coverage.</p>

<p>He read it quickly and said, “Okay, let’s go.”</p>

<p>The reporters collectively hit the phones and streets in organized teams.</p>

<p>“Three hours,” I reminded them. “Make sure you keep in touch with me.”</p>

<p>The entire organization had its finest moment in those next few hours. Everyone pitched in. Soon we started trying to guess the casualties. We learned more than 50,000 people worked in those Twin Towers. We discussed applicable comparisons. One editor suggested we compare it to the entire number of casualties lost in the Vietnam War. We pushed the human appalling helplessness and sadness to the back so we could just focus on the job.</p>

<p>The first newspapers hit the street on time at 3 p.m. as cars lined up out front of the building. Receptionists sold copies outside the building like hawkers from the 1920s. Upstairs in the newsroom we didn’t have time to stop. The entire process had to be updated and repeated by the 11 p.m. deadline for our normal morning edition. The Boss was still reading stories at home even as the final pages were sent to print, for the second time that day. He may have been a pain in the ass, but he was a journalist who knew his shit. On that day, we all rose to the top of our game. Everyone knew that this was the reason we did the jobs we did: Breaking news. It made the low pay, long hours and reporting boring stories in bumfuck Egypt worth it.</p>

<p>Somewhere amid all my responsibilities, I wrote our front-page analysis:</p>

<p><strong>Title: Tragedy Without A Name
Date: September 12, 2001
By: Andrew Scot Bolsinger</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soon, a name will be given to a single day so shocking, that for now at least, it defies naming.</p>

  <p>World Trade Center Attack? No, that was just the opening chapter. Airline Terrorism? Does nothing to describe the heart-wrenching deaths of New York firefighters coming to the rescue of others.</p>

  <p>Throughout the day, news anchors compared Tuesday’s horror — played out live before a nation’s astonished eyes — to Pearl Harbor as perhaps the greatest attack on American soil.</p>

  <p>The very scope of it all — four hijacked commercial airplanes crashing throughout the East Coast, dive-bombing the Pentagon, destroying both towers of the World Trade Center, crashing in the country’s heartland — defies a name.</p>

  <p>Evil does that. It transcends our capacity to imagine, much less name.</p>

  <p>Fifty years from now we will remember where we were and what we saw when this disaster took place. By then, whatever name sticks to label this American nightmare will be remote history to the next generation.</p>

  <p>It will be in history books. Other generations won’t grasp the terror, because by then, evil will probably find even more horrible ways to display itself.</p>

  <p>But I doubt we will forget.</p>

  <p>We won’t forget the images on the television screens, or the sad wish that this were just another made-for-television movie.</p>

  <p>We won’t forget the surreal images of towering infernos with no sign of the absolute horror taking place inside and on the streets below.</p>

  <p>We won’t forget the empty feeling in our stomachs, as we struggled to comprehend the staggering reality of the thousands of lives struck down.</p>

  <p>The evil of this day has seared a nation’s soul. But history also teaches us that it will not crush our resolve. For a day, one tragic, horrible day, America was brought to a standstill.</p>

  <p>In the days to come, Americans everywhere will unite with a resolve to thwart this evil and others in the world like it.</p>

  <p>This event will soon be named. When it is, let’s hope it stands for the country at its best in times of tragedy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We wrapped around 12:30 a.m. only to return en masse by 8 a.m. the next day. Not a single person complained about long hours or even questioned it. Nobody had to ask anyone to come in early and stay late. We again published two special editions, working long past midnight. The Features Editor designed beautiful news pages. Reporters covered different beats. The work just got done. On the third day we went back to one edition, but included an eight-page special section on follow-up coverage of the events of 9/11, the tragedy that now had a name.</p>
