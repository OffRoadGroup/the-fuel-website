                <p class="big"><p>The <a href="http://www.freewayrick.com/?page_id=23">real Rick Ross</a> has a compelling story to tell, but it may not be the one you’d expect.</p>

<p>Sure, the millions he made every day selling crack in my childhood home of Southern California is part of the story, just as is how a man who made an estimated $600 million didn’t know how to read. A huge part of the story is how the man known as Freeway Rick Ross played a role in the larger Iran-Contra Scandal that rocked the Reagan administration and sold drugs that were likely trafficked by the American government itself.</p>

<p>Folks reading this story would be interested in how he sued the rap star Rick Ross for <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/53470-rick-ross-legally-gets-to-keep-his-name-shares-bound-2-freestyle/">taking his birth name</a>. Freeway Rick Ross is the real Rick Ross, you best believe.</p>

<p>Still part of the story is how he fought his legal case, won his freedom and is <a href="http://www.freewayrick.com/?page_id=30">now rebuilding the very community</a> he once filled with drugs.</p>

<p>The man’s story is packed with narrative and subplots and interesting political and cultural perspectives, which explains why he wrote a book in the first place (click <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freeway-Rick-Ross-Untold-Autobiography/dp/1499651538">here</a> to get a copy).</p>

<p>But no, none of that is the story. Ricky Ross is the story of talent and how much of it is packed inside the barbed wires and bars of America’s prisons.</p>

<p>“We have probably some of our best and most creative people in prison,” Freeway Rick Ross told me in a recent phone interview. “People who sell drugs are willing to risk their lives and their freedoms to accomplish a goal. These are the people we need in America to do business because they have a will that can’t be stopped.”</p>

<p>That is the song and I am the choir. Having seen it firsthand, I know how we have stigmatized and demonized the men and women behind bars, and in so doing missed the enormous potential lost to drugs, poverty, and generational crime.  It’s why any true reform effort must flow from within the prisons themselves rather than be created outside of it, as I have fiercely advocated in my call for a Criminal U Reunion Conference.</p>

<p>Ross couldn’t read when he was sent to prison, but he knew he could teach.  He used those skills to build an empire few have the acumen and drive to create.</p>

<p>“I’ve been teaching people all my life,” he said. “My number one attribute was teaching people how to sell drugs. What I did was I taught guys how to sell drugs well, which was really teaching people how to do business. It was just a product. It could have been drugs, cars, tennis shoes.”</p>

<p>So now as Ross rebuilds his post-prison life he focuses again on what he does best: teach. He wants to establish mentoring programs and has launched a slew of programs meant to increase the movement of prison reform and to give re-entering citizens a better chance of success.</p>

<p>“He’s giving back, seeking no accolades for himself, just those men who are institutionalized and imprisoned in their mind,” said Madeline Coburn, an activist and spiritual counselor to inmates on death row in Missouri. “Those are the one’s he’s trying to reach if given the opportunity to help change their lives.”</p>

<p>Ross wants to shatter the narrative that if you’re born poor or born black you aren’t smart or will end up in a gang. He wants others to learn what he had to teach himself, that he had skills and abilities that would help be successful in whatever he chose.</p>

<p>“They are identical,” he said of the skills he’s using to build his civic-minded business now as compared to the skills he used to become a drug kingpin in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>He wants others to see the potential in themselves.</p>

<p>“If they intentionally make you feel dumb or stupid it don’t mean that you are,” he said. “When they see me doing the things I’m doing, they can do the same things or even greater.”</p>

<p>Ross knows where he came from and the news he helped create remains part of his compelling story. It’s not often Jane Pauley and national news television dedicated 10 minutes to a story you are intricately involved in, but that’s what happened to Ross. This remains captivating news decades after it happened as it sheds light into the government’s duplicity in waging a “war on drugs” while helping to fuel the drug trade.</p>

<p>But Ross says he is content to let the past be the past.</p>

<p>“I don’t really harp on that much because I don’t live in the past,” he said. “I’m more of a future guy. I believe that my best days are yet to come. If I can keep chasing the past I can never to my future.”</p>

<p>So he continues to build. He is involved in the music business and has a documentary project, has backed a nonprofit effort to mentor and educate others and is interested in seeing the entrepreneurial talent of felons be tapped into to create positive change.</p>

<p>“I’m all over the place,” he said. “Speaking, the book, the documentary. I’m just all over the place. I just try to give folks the information that I’ve learned from my life. I believe that information is beneficial for anybody. It can help you avoid the pitfalls of life.”</p>

<p>Like he said, he is at heart a teacher. Education, he believes, as we tout at Criminal U is crucial.</p>

<p>“The most rebellious thing a person can do is get educated,” the rap lyrics state, as we tout here at Criminal U.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Ross says in agreement. “I’ve been doing this all my life.”</p>

<p>Only now he’s directing it in a way that builds up our communities rather than the funnel the drugs that tear it down.</p>

<p>That is the real story of Freeway Ricky Ross and it’s being written every day.</p>
