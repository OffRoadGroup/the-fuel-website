                <p class="big"><p>You see it every day inside the barbed wire and walls of American prisons. An inmate packs his or her things after a night of mini-celebrations and anxious waiting. Good-byes are said to those staying inside. The person headed out makes a passionate promise: “I’ll get at you brother. I’ll be in touch.”</p>

<p>Most mean it. Few do it.</p>

<p>No sooner than free air fill the lungs of the newly departed, good intention of reaching back inside to help evaporates like mist. Good intentions don’t put money on the phone or pen to paper in a letter or more importantly to do something the person left inside can’t do for themselves.</p>

<p>It’s why Eric Barden is truly heroic. Not only did he promise Antonio Yarbough to help, but he kept the promise, just as he would any member of his family. It required a lot of time, persistence and faith. Not only did he follow through, he went far beyond the extra mile to ensure his friend from inside, who faced 75-years-to life, someday joined him outside.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to leave him in there, man. You must be crazy,” he says. “Not nobody you ate with for five years. You break bread with and you can’t leave that.  I got home, first and foremost, and tried to take care of myself and make sure my mom’s OK. But at the same time you don’t forget the people you were loyal with in jail. We’re like a family. You understand one thing only and that is you will do everything for that person.”</p>

<p>When few had hope for Yarbough, Barden did. When few believed his innocence, Barden did. More importantly he put that hope and belief into action.</p>

<p>Yarbough is a free man today, exonerated of the murder of his mother and little sister that he did not commit, in large part because Barden got out and went to work on his behalf.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it myself,” Barden says of his role in the nearly six-year effort to free Yarbough. “I knew something was funny. I knew, I knew. You know when you get a gut feeling and I knew I had to do something. Because that’s my boy.”</p>

<p>Barden started by searching Google for “pro bono attorney.” Barden spent more than 16 years in prison from the time he was 22. He didn’t know how to use a computer much less own one. He borrowed his brother’s and got to work.</p>

<p>He found <a href="http://zmolaw.com/attorney-profiles/free-tony-yarbough/">Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma</a>, a successful Manhattan-based defense attorney who actually takes serious his ethical responsibility to offer pro bono services.</p>

<p>Margulis-Ohnuma invited Barden to his office. Barden made the long trek from outer Queens in a suit and tie and told the attorney about his friend left behind. Margulis-Ohnuma took the case.</p>

<p>“That’s what amazing to me is that he followed up, and even family members of Zachary followed up,” Barden said.</p>

<p>It was amazing because at first it seemed the only way to correct the possible miscarriage of justice was to solve the crime itself. Margulis-Ohnuma sensed the case was a bad conviction based entirely on a forced confession and brow-beating a 15-year-old kid named Shariff Wilson to point the finger at his friend Yarbough even though both were gone when the crimes were committed.</p>

<p>Margulis-Ohnuma connected the case to a Brooklyn-based attorney, Phillip Smallman, who had already gotten one man exonerated and knew the tainted record of the district attorney’s office at that time. Smallman agreed to come aboard representing Wilson.</p>

<p>The break in the case came when DNA found at the scene was tested. The test revealed that DNA was also found at another murder nine years later when Yarbough was already locked up. Still the case dragged on.</p>

<p>“I stayed in contact with Zachary and he let me know what was happening. Every court date I had to be there,” Barden says.</p>

<p>Back inside, Yarbough began to experience hope. Margulis-Ohnuma’s sister came to visit. She put him contact with us at Criminal U. Soon Yarbough was getting letters, small gifts, a care package– things that reminded him he was not alone.</p>

<p>Then on February 7, 2014, Yarbough was exonerated along with Wilson. Just 48 hours after being an inmate and a number he was the guest of Piers Morgan on CNN. One week later he celebrated his 40th birthday, the first he celebrated outside of prison since he turned 18.</p>

<p>“I’m proud of both of them lawyers,” Barden said.</p>

<p>Barden and his family provided Yarbough a place to live. The two friends have been supporting one another, encouraging one another and adapting together to life on the outside. Both are defying the long odds by staying out of prison, a battle that began for Barden six years ago and continues.</p>

<p>“I think the major thing that helped me out is coming home to a family, my brother and my mother.  A house in Queens and the environment is nice, not where I grew up in Brooklyn,” Barden said.</p>

<p>Barden grew up in the infamous Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, known mostly during Barden’s youth for its crack sales and violence. His family’s move to Queens helped him avoid trouble when he got out. He passed all he learned to Yarbough when he got out.</p>

<p>Both have had troubled finding permanent work, even though Yarbough has no criminal record. Barden also remains on parole and under supervision, which puts restrictions on his ability to kick-start his life. He still is looking for permanent work in maintenance, something he enjoys doing.</p>

<p>“It’s hard for people of color with records to get a job. It’s about who you know. You can’t get a job with parole,” he says.</p>

<p>Still he’s not discouraged. He will finish parole no later than January 2017. He and Yarbough want to work together to help young men avoid the prison system. He is confident it will all fall in place because he already defied the long odds by not going back to prison.</p>

<p>“The best thing I pat myself on the back about is I’m not doing nothing bad. I’m trying to stay free,” he says.</p>

<p>But the even longer odds he defied is what truly shows the man’s character. He didn’t forget the “family” he left behind. Keeping his word he gave the day he left Attica was the one thing he was absolutely sure he was going to do when he got out.</p>

<p>“The best thing I’m going to live for is the loyalty to people,” he says. “But the things that are wrong with system, I’m going to work against it. I’m going to make difference.”</p>

<p>He already has in a significant way.</p>
