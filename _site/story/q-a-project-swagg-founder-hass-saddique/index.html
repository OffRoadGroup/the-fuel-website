                <p class="big"><p>Everybody’s got a hustle in prison. Everybody. But that’s not always a bad thing.</p>

<p>You see it all the time. Wheels are turning, grinding a squeaky wheel while they wonder what in the hell are they going to do when they get out.</p>

<p>This is a breeding ground for entrepreneurs. Some will use those skills to learn how to crime better. But others will set their mind in a new direction.</p>

<p>They know when they get out they’ll have felon stamped next to their name. They know the opportunities will be limited. So they focus on how to make their own opportunities. This entrepreneurial spirit is the flower that grows amid the weeds of the industrialized prison economy.</p>

<p>I look for it now. When I find it, I’m usually impressed. When impressed, sometimes I find myself motivated to do more. Talking to Hass Saddique, founder of Project SWAGG, was one of those experiences. This is a guy whose hustle is helping others while building a brand that will be a job creator for those coming behind him.</p>

<p>The Swagg Man was kind enough to do a little Q&amp;A for CriminalU.</p>

<p><strong>Tell me about your experience inside?</strong></p>

<p>Honestly man, my experience inside inspired me. What I mean by that is I never seen myself in prison. Not long before I got into running weapons and getting caught, I was playing pro ball in Argentina and not long before that I was in college. Not long before that I was running the streets of Buffalo headed down the wrong path so it was full circle.</p>

<p>Basketball saved my life. My thinking going in was I knew I had to do my time and use the time I had wisely and get my ass home. When your in the federal system you really meet the best of the best criminals “laughing,” but you also meet some genuine guys as well.</p>

<p>I was a top basketball prospect on the compound so my transition was easy. My team actually lost in the championship which sucks because we should’ve won, but hey.</p>

<p>For the first time people saw things in me I didn’t see in myself. What I mean by that is I was rubbing shoulders with a lawyer, a medical doctor and a politician — all white guys — which never happened to me until I was in prison. What irony, and of course I surrounded myself with some of the sharpest brothers on the compound as well.</p>

<p>I worked in the infamous Lewisburg Pen. My job was very humbling and an unforgettable experience. I basically used my time to network and set my plan to produce TV, music and movies.</p>

<p><strong>What made you shift toward becoming an entrepreneur?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve actually always had entrepreneurial tendencies from a very young age. I had launched a product while I was on pre-trial and that product actually helped me keep cash flow during my bid. Of course it would’ve sold much more if I was home to promote it, but hey, things happen. Seeing that product make sales showed me that I had a knack to create things that can make money.</p>

<p>At that point I never seen it fit to jump in the world of having a 9 to 5 and investing in another person’s dream. I feel I should invest in my dreams and aspirations. Now don’t get me wrong, things sometimes have gotten slow in my business and I might have to grab a job for a couple months.</p>

<p>Another reason why I choose to be an entrepreneur is that you can make your own luck. You make the decision to get up and go hard. That’s attractive to me.</p>

<p><strong>Like a lot of former inmates, you have a focus on social action and community service Where did that focus come from?</strong></p>

<p>Well it didn’t start like that. I’m was producing/starring in this makeover TV show and for the finale episode I wanted to do more, so I had an idea of giving a kid with cancer a fresh start surprise. I met a kid named Jason that had leukemia and I filmed with Jason and his family for three days. And each day filming I could not sleep after each day because I felt God put me in this position. The first day I brought a pro hockey player to his home and talked to him and family about his story. Day two we took Jason and his family to the hockey game, and day three we gave Jason a bedroom swaggover.</p>

<p>This experience changed my life. I felt that it’s so many stories like Jason’s that go untold and over looked. From there we re-cut that episode and renamed the series Project SWAGG. This docu-series would tell the stories of kids and families with challenges and for each family that told me their story I would attempt to help them do something EPIC. I went on to meet more kids and families and I knew this is what I wanted to do forever if possible.</p>

<p>__How did you come up with the idea for your brand?
__</p>

<p>I guess the above answer tells about how this all came about. But the one thing I didn’t mention is that I had to find a way to fund all this. So I came up with a design of a PiNK ELEPHANT named LEE that would symbolize the pink elephant in the room, which is the stories that go untold and over looked. I would put this pink elephant design on t-shirt, hoodies, tanks, etc. to make money to fund each EPIC experience.</p>

<p><strong>What advice do you have for inmates who think about what they are going to do next?</strong></p>

<p>The advice I would give first is to believe in yourself and work hard! People are what they are and what I mean by that is some folks going to want you to do good and others are not going to like what your doing either way so you have to just stay even keeled and believe in YOU and your product or idea. Try to do the right thing in every situation. I live by this and it helps me so much. Focus. There are so many distractions out here so you have to focus and keep feeding your mind with information. Set goals and achieve them.</p>

<p>The most important advice is to keep GOD first and fill the universe with positive energy all that negative shit leave that with them negative folks.</p>

<p><strong>In the article I read you said once you got a “white” face your business took off. That completely blows of course, but anyone of us who work with organizations focused on people of color see this all too often. Tell us how you are breaking down these stereotypes? Advice for others?</strong></p>

<p>I’m not. This is America, man. It is what it is. You have to play the game unfortunately. My advice would be to make the moves necessary to get ahead without losing yourself and integrity. You have to be smart. Those companies and rich folks are always going to underestimate you until you prove other so use that as an advantage. Go under the radar and kill ’em slowly and consistent before you know you will be a force to be reckoned with. It’s sad that is like that but if your doing something that means something, they don’t like it.</p>

<p>All you have to do is take a look at the TV and listen to the radio. The shit that’s on TV like the black-targeted reality shows is hurting us as black folks. Perception is reality so if we are perceived like the cast of Love and Hip Hop then it becomes people’s reality. It’s real to them, not just entertainment. Unless it’s a balance where people can see different images of blacks then they have a choice of who to emulate. The same goes with music nothing on the radio is positive its all party drink, money, bitches/ hoes, cars, I will shoot you. The shit is crazy!! Now, true all that stuff happens in the world and people are speaking their reality, but guess what it’s other people that are speaking knowledge and its good music but that stuff doesn’t get played on the radio.</p>

<p>The problem is that there is no balance.</p>

<p><strong>What’s going on with you and your business now? Is it a struggle? How are doing? What does the future plans entail?</strong></p>

<p>Right now I have a few things going on with my business but the most important thing for me is being here in Buffalo right now so my daughters can finish the school year. Then I’m back to Hollywood and getting back on the grind. As far as business we just cut a new sizzle reel that I’m planning to pitch to networks. Im also working on my Fall/ Winter 2014 line that I will be displaying at the Pool trade show in August. Im also working on a partnership with the Jabbawockeez to get a kid named Jordan to Vegas to meet them and attend their show at Luxor. Jordan is a 9-year-old that is in remission from leg cancer. He is one of the kids featured in our docu-series. I’m also working to get another kid from the docu-series to meet Derek Jeter before the season is out. Because of his retirement its going to be tough.</p>

<p>It’s always a struggle when you don’t have a major company backing you. So the plan is to partner with a network that will give us a budget to travel and meet these kids and families tell their story and do EPIC shit!! I’m also hoping to get a big retailer on board like Target or Kohls to get our LEE the Pink ELEPHANT in the room clothing is distributed in.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of support do you want from readers?</strong></p>

<p>Readers should immediately go <a href="http://swagguniversity.com/shop/">buy some of our clothing</a>. I know some guys will be too macho to wear pink but it’s classic man. I would tell those macho guys wear it as well and if your that macho if somebody says something about them wearing pink just molly-wop them. Just kidding.</p>

<p>They should wear our stuff because it has a great cause and its classic. Also share our story and video with your friends because without people sharing the information and the movement it’s consumed but not shared to others.</p>

<p>__Like I said, inspiring to all of us to do more. And Criminal U is down with Lee the Pink Elephant. We will soon be rocking that. I’m clicking over about… now. Join me. __</p>
