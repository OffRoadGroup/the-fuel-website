                <p class="big"><p>Shaka Senghor’s childhood in Detroit went mostly according to plan. He was abused as a child, a victim of gun violence as a teen, a criminal drug dealer and eventually the man squeezing the trigger. Another man died, Senghor ended up in prison, a slick slide down the school-to-prison pipeline that fueled the industrialized prison industry for the last three decades. The plan didn’t include life beyond prisons.</p>

<p>What happened next was was anything but the plan. While serving 19 years, seven in solitary, Senghor defied the odds — and the plan — and changed the course of his life.</p>

<p>“I was sent to prison at the age of 19 for second-degree murder. I spent my time reading and writing, using books to free my mind and expand my thinking. I clung to words–my own and others–as I pulled myself out of the anger that led me to prison and kept me from reaching my full potential,” he says now.</p>

<p>Like those who have been inside Criminal U, Senghor saw the brokenness all around him. Unlike many, he saw it in himself as well. He faced it. He figured out how to heal and began to envision life beyond prison.</p>

<p>So what’s all this about some plan, you may ask? It’s not like his plan for life was kill someone and end up in prison. It’s not like police and public officials sit around and say, “hey, this kid will use a gun, then we can lock him up.”</p>

<p>But somehow that became expected, even the norm, in places like Detroit, and Oakland, and Richmond, and urban locations all over the country until we became a nation that sent hundreds of thousands of people–mostly young men, and disproportionately black men–to prison.</p>

<p>Maybe saying such pain and brokenness “was the plan” is too jaded. But plan or not, our entire system ignored a truth that Senghor discovered in his personal reclamation project.</p>

<p>“Hurt people hurt people, and a lot of people are hurting,” he says. “We keep turning a deaf ear to their pain.”</p>

<p>Senghor’s new memoir, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-My-Wrongs-Redemption-American/dp/1101907290">Writing My Wrongs</a>, chronicles his story. It has captivated readers since its release earlier this month, already hitting the New York Times Best Seller list. It captivated Oprah for goodness sakes. Oprah, mind you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My first glance at the person on the book’s cover—a dreadlocked, tattooed, heavyset blackmale—left me skeptical. Full of judgment,” said Oprah. “‘Why should I be interested in the story of a murderer?’ But as his words unfolded, so did my understanding—of what it means to fall short, to go astray, to lose your way.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Senghor’s life has gone to a new plan since a turning point in prison, inspired by a letter from his young son. He was twice denied parole but made a vow to the parole board that if he were ever released, he would dedicate his life to helping others and becoming a writer.</p>

<p>On June 22, 2010, one day after his 38th birthday, he was released from prison and was finally a free man. He stood by his words he shared with the parole board member, his family, and friends and became an activist and mentor to young men and women facing circumstances like his. His work in the community and the courage to share his story led him to fellowships at the MIT Media Lab and the Kellogg Foundation and invitations to speak at events like TED and the Aspen Ideas Festival.</p>

<p>Senghor has emerged as a leading voice for reform. More importantly, he represents the wealth of talent that exists among the millions of Criminal U alumni. Many, like Senghor, are deeply committed to the reform movement, and most have both talent and experience that is critical to genuine reform. The more ex-inmates like Senghor sit at the table of reform, the more likely that effort will be successful at changing a system that to date has proven adept of breaking the human spirit.</p>

<p>Senghor is both an example and a voice for the human potential that exists in the bleakest places on Earth. His is a call to all of us, to do what we can to reclaim that human potential both within ourselves and with those we connect with every day.</p>
