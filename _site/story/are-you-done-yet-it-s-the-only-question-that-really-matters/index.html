                <p class="big"><p>I recently wrote a letter to a young man in county jail I had never met. I asked a simple question: “Are you done yet?”</p>

<p>I asked it repeatedly, because really, for someone sitting inside, it’s the only question that really matters. His mom had reached out to us at Criminal U and asked us to write him. We did so gladly. He was in jail. He had avoided doing serious prison time. He was already preparing for his return to life very soon. He hadn’t had much time to truly get sober, get serious and get real.</p>

<p>Yet, I loved his answer.</p>

<p>“I’m so done,” he wrote me.</p>

<p>I have no choice but to take him at his word. I know well, especially for addicts like this young man, that even the best of intentions often fall short. Even those who seemingly do everything right while inside head back out and trip up, relapse, re-offend, and return to the revolving door of prison life. For those under the age of 23 even the best of intentions face terribly long odds: 84 in a 100 will return to prison.</p>

<p>That’s why we write to people in prison. That’s why we try to help with their network when they get out. That’s why we created Inside Innovations as a means to tapping that criminal energy and turn it to pro-social success.</p>

<p>And that’s why I ask over and over again. “Are you done yet?”</p>

<p>The problem we have to confront if we are going to change those terrible odds of leaving prison behind is we have to change our approach. We have to find out who is truly done and pump energy into these candidates. We also have to start figuring out long before they get out.</p>

<p>We have a legitimate way to do that. Those who know the best are the very people we aren’t asking. Ask other inmates about a guy on their block, or a guy they work with in the kitchen, or even better a cellie. Ask them if the guy they know is done.</p>

<p>They know. They get it right far more often than they get it wrong.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people">Norwegian prison system</a> figured this out. Their guards function with the inmates in normal ways, all in an effort to humanize them, prepare them for re-entry with an important side-effect of getting to truly know them. I suspect those guards know who is really done.</p>

<p>In America the guards know very little. The inmates, well, they know.</p>

<p>Here is just one example: At the end of my sentence for the final 18 months I worked as a tutor with about a dozen others helping guys earn their GEDs. The job was considered one of the better ones. You had to apply and had to have some references from others who worked their. The education department needed the right people who could both help, but also deflate the criminal code energy that keeps guys from reaching their potential.</p>

<p>One of the guys I helped get a job there came to me and said he knew someone named Brian he thought would be a good tutor. I vouched for Brian, even though I didn’t know him.</p>

<p>Two weeks later my friend came to me and apologized. He had vouched for the wrong guy. We all knew it. Brian was no where near done. He said all the right things, he talked a good game, he was a smart guy. But Brian hadn’t learned a thing about his crimes and his behavior and was a sure bet to re-offend once he was released. We all could see it. But because he talked a good game and was “cool” with the guards, he kept getting promoted into better work crews with better jobs.</p>

<p>I was the least surprised when that friend emailed me recently with a news article about Brian. He had been out just a few months and was already back in jail: “Accused scam artist busted for allegedly ripping off handicapped and financially distressed people,” the newspaper reported.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brian Page, 47 of Newport, has been arrested by Newport Police following reports that Page would seek out mentally handicapped or financially distressed people on the internet, give them a bad check and then keep their money. Police say Page would “carefully choose people to cash checks for him that were forged.” In return for cashing the checks “Page would promise the person or business owner that their debts would be partially or fully paid.” Police say most of these fraudulent transactions were going on in Newport and in the Otter Rock area. They also say that Page may have contacted a great many more victims than what they’ve found out about. Police are asking anyone or any business that may have been a victim to call Newport Police at 541-265-4849. Page is being held in the Lincoln County Jail in lieu of a third of a million dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>via <a href="http://www.newslincolncounty.com/archives/59758">Accused scam artist busted for allegedly ripping off handicapped and financially distressed people</a>.</p>

<p>He wasn’t done. We all knew it.</p>

<p>The system as it exists now has few ways to tapping into the knowledge that comes from other inmates. As a result, finding those who are done and will benefit from the newly discovered interest in prison re-entry will never be as effective in targeting limited resources to those who will most benefit.</p>

<p>The only solution: Start early. Go inside the prisons and get to know the people in there. They will reveal themselves. Inside Innovations tries to not only change the culture inside a prison, but use the time spent in prison in finding and training people who are done, and thus ready to make a meaningful change. Too much of the current effort is focused on when a guy leaves prison. The result will be far too many failures. We need to start the re-entry effort earlier. We need to tap the knowledge of those who know.</p>

<p>Are you done yet? I ask every time. Guys don’t always know. Many intend to be done. But more often than not, inmates can figure it out.</p>

<p>For those truly done there is no guarantee of success. But those who aren’t, like my old pal Brian, there is nothing that can be done for them.</p>

<p>Figuring out the difference is the missing link to truly lowering those terrible recidivism rates and the significant challenge for those seeking innovative solutions in the years to come.</p>
