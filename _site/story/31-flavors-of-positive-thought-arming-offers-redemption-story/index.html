                <p class="big"><p>Remember back in the day just how incredibly excessive the very idea of 31 different ice cream flavors under one delightful counter felt? Long before Ben &amp; Jerry’s took ice cream and ice-cream flavors to a whole new level, Baskin and Robbins would set the minds of kids like me into a decadent blur with the sheer panoply of choice. It was euphoric.</p>

<p>So with that in mind I crafted my own 31 flavors of positive thought arming a long time ago. Each one is a pearl on a necklace of excessive, decadent, euphoric positivity for me. If I’m going to face the utter intensity of this life and so well, I need to stay positive and arm my mind with relentless thoughts of possibility that each in their own way say, “this life is well worth living.”</p>

<p>I crafted my personal positive thought arming arsenal back in prison, while in rehab, battling a 20-year dance with booze that was killing me and had already robbed me of my moral compass. In a long, long time of darkness these were the darkest days. By putting them together, committing them to memory and saying them in bits and pieces throughout the day, they saturated my brain with energy and resolve. These thoughts slipped together in a row, one after the other, each speaking directly to my soul and my mind that hope will truly never die.</p>

<p>1) Love (It all starts with love): And they lived happily ever after — Aesop. (My wife and I said this all the way through, believing our fairy tale could survive. It did and still does and that’s why it’s first on the list).</p>

<p>2) Honesty: God reveal to my own eyes… let me examine myself again, more closely — Augustine. The idea of repentance and self-examination, once something I drank to avoid, became a positive reminder for me as I journeyed back to health. It still is, part of my daily routine with the 11th step of Alcoholics Anonymous encouraging me to conduct a Daily Moral Inventory to continue the work of transformation.</p>

<p>3) Resilience: Choose to survive well — Gandhi. We can’t often choose much, especially in places like prison or rehab (or in my case both at the same time!). But we can choose to survive well. I must have said this 1,500 times, at least once a day for every day I spent in Criminal U.</p>

<p>4) Acceptance: Shogani. A Japanese word used after the devastating Tsunami that I understand to mean: a calm determination to overcome that what cannot be controlled.</p>

<p>5) Humility: It’s amazing what can be accomplished if we don’t care who gets the credit — President Ronald Reagan. Instead of worrying about me I began to focus on what can be accomplished a very positive lens from which to view even the toughest circumstance.</p>

<p>6) Discipline: Just do it — Nike. I probably still say this five times a day and usually see a positive outcome.</p>

<p>7) Excellence: We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit –Aristotle. From humility and discipline comes a renewed hope and focus toward excellence.</p>

<p>8) Determination: It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you don’t stop — Confucius Another of my go-to weapons whenever I get discouraged with the long road ahead.</p>

<p>9) Grace: By God’s tender mercies, the morning light of heaven is about to break upon us and… lead us to the path of peace — Zechariah, father of John the Baptist.  This was one of those times when God seemed to speak directly to me, urging me on and assuring me not to lose hope.</p>

<p>10) Peace: Be at peace as much as it depends on you. — St. Paul</p>

<p>11) Faith: Be anxious for nothing but instead pray about everything — St. Paul. Peace and faith often go hand in hand. Both shape my focus toward a positive outcome even in the darkest times.</p>

<p>12) Hope: For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you; plans to give you hope and a future — Jeremiah the prophet. Who doesn’t feel more positive reading this?</p>

<p>13) Integrity: Do the right thing. And then do the next right thing. And so on. This cliché is used often in rehab, but like “Just do it” this has amazingly simple power to rebuild your moral compass — the first thing to go when sliding into alcoholism — one right act after another.</p>

<p>14) Excellence: Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds — Albert Einstein.  To remind me to dream and not be discouraged by those that don’t.</p>

<p>15) Patience: Man is the strangest of all animals. He is the only one to run faster after he has lost his way — Rollo May. A reminder to “slow my roll” and trust the long process of success.</p>

<p>16) Service: True service cannot be taken advantage of — Dale Murphy.</p>

<p>17) Integrity: Just say no — Nancy Reagan. It helps. A lot. Repeat it again. Go back to #13 and repeat it again. Stay the course.</p>

<p>18) Discipline: Learn to define life backwards and live it forward — Soren Kierkegaard</p>

<p>19) Acceptance: Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. Once we truly know that life is difficult than it ceases to be so — M. Scott Peck. (Yes, Peck needed an editor so I trimmed this up for him). Acceptance is one of the most positive things I can do.</p>

<p>20) Kindness: Be kind — Lori Bolsinger.  She’s the kindest person I know. The more I’m with her, the more I see it in myself.</p>

<p>21) Interdependence: “There are two questions a man must ask himself: The first is ‘Where am I going?’ and the second is ‘Who will go with me?’ — Sam Keen. This seems like a strange one for a positive thought arming but I read Fire in the Belly as a young man and it shaped my thinking more than just about any books I’ve read short of the Bible. Reminding myself this helps keep from life’s Drama, with a capital D, that so often derails me from my truest sense of self.</p>

<p>22) Discipline: You can be brilliant and you can be stupid. Most of us are only stupid. Just become more brilliant and less stupid — Wayne Trussell. A true friend in his first letter to me in rehab. Few things mean as much to me.</p>

<p>23) Discipline: It’s supposed to be hard. If it was easy anyone could do it. It’s the hard that makes it great — Jimmy Dugan. Those who know me, know I’m a big fan of the Tom Hanks character in A League of Their Own. This line sticks out from many.</p>

<p>24) Discipline: No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening. It is painful. But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living — St. Paul. See a theme here? That’s how transformation takes place. Through the mud comes a renewed sense of hope and even self. But it takes miles and miles of discipline, something I didn’t have before, to see it through.</p>

<p>25) Kindness: Follow the platinum rule: treat others how they want to be treated. Another saying I picked up in rehab. It’s beautiful. It removes self from the equation, as kindness truly should be. Nothing fuels the tank like kindness and selflessness.</p>

<p>26) Empathy: A good listener is more rare than an adequate lover — John MacDonald. The closer I neared renewal the less I thought about me. My ears opened.</p>

<p>27) Faith: The worst has already happened and been repaired… All shall be well, all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well — Julian of Norwich.</p>

<p>28) Freedom: To be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others — Nelson Mandela. These are like glasses that I put on now to view life and everything in it.</p>

<p>29) Gratefulness: When I reflect on my family and friends, I am lifted up in celebration — Maya Angelou</p>

<p>30) Acceptance: Choose the hill you want to die on.  Just one of those reminders that so much of what we think is worth it, truly isn’t. I’m not sure where I heard this, but it stuck.</p>

<p>31) Love: God is constantly coloring outside the lines. Jesus challenges the structures that oppose and exclude. God busts through our traditions that put limitations on love. Love cannot be harnessed — Common Prayer for Ordinary Radicals.</p>

<p>And my positive thought arming begins where it ends, with love. Because as St. Paul said, “the greatest of these is love.”</p>

<p>Be positive. Be armed. Be well.</p>
