                <p class="big"><p>I’ve always loved surfing. I love the grittiness, the salt, the power of the ocean, its relentlessness. But I can’t surf. I’ve tried often, but having left the beach at 17 when I headed off to college, my attempts to surf were sporadic, not to mention ridiculously repetitive. Practice on the sand. Feel awkward. Paddle out. Feel even more awkward as the board slips around and out from under me until I try to tame it like a wild horse. Wave coming. Flip over. Tumble. Paddle again. Really, really awkward. Turtle under a wave. Crest another. Reach the calm. Whew. Exhausted, insecure but slightly pleased. Until it dawns on me. I haven’t ridden a wave yet. Paddle, paddle, paddle furiously….miss the wave, slide back. “Son of a bitch!” Look ahead. Fellow surfers riding waves. Having time of their lives. Deep breath. Paddle, paddle, paddle like your life depends on it…and suddenly a great power propels you forward and its…heaven. Magical. But you can’t wait. Pop up! Too soon… You stand and it looks like a cliff into nothingness ahead of you, which you realize you are falling head long into…CRASH, TUMBLE, EYES STING FROM SALT, SAND GRINDS INTO SKIN, LUNGS GASP FOR AIR UNTIL like Jonah you are spewed up onto the beach, your board slapping behind you like a dog on a leash, looking at you expectantly like, “What are you doing sitting down. Come on! Let’s go do it again! Can we? Can we?!”</p>

<p>… gasping breath, soggy head, burned skin… you say to yourself, “That was so scary…It was … (pant, pant) AWESOME!”</p>

<p>You try again and again. You feel the Chi in your board shorts. You know you’re close. The aha moment is coming, if only I can get back out there one more time. Fatigue has set in though. You need a break. You sit on the beach on watch the seemingly effortless flow of surfers hilariously riding waves with the panache of a painter at a canvas. Soon, you think.</p>

<p>But the vacation is over. Months pass. Snow falls. You snowboard and feel the thrill. But in the back of your mind you think, God I wish I could surf too.</p>

<p>When you finally make it back it’s like starting all over again, which it is because you’ve not tried for months and months. You grow older. You get fatter. It seems more and more impossible, perhaps an opportunity forever lost. Maybe it’s just not in my DNA, you think. You have only wishful thinking and a crystal clear memory of that glorious second or two standing on the precipice of the abyss and (in your mind) riding the power of the universe like a bat out of hell. Those were a great two seconds, you think lingering with the odd mixture of contentedness and longing.</p>

<p>Yes, I love surfing even though I can’t do it Even now, I’m pulled. Summer is coming soon and this year… Goddamnit ALL I will truly surf, I vow.</p>

<p>My spiritual life is pretty close to my efforts to surf. It’s the closest experience I’ve ever had figuring what a spiritual journey is like. It captures those moments of ecstasy riding the power that fuels the universe. It vividly models the relentlessness needed to maintain the journey.</p>

<p>The ocean is like the lion, the king of the jungle of God’s creative world. Riding it is to ride within the flow of God’s power. Learning the effortlessness needed to ride it well is the key to the spiritual journey.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I am convinced the Bible and nature and our experience speak to this creative force in the world — this thing we call God that can be pictured as a giant wave — flowing in contrast to the destructive rip tides of hate in the world.</p>

<p>So as we hit Rule 16, I simply advise that no matter how many times you crash out into the sand, keep paddling. Surf the creative energy in this world to find what its like to truly live.</p>

<p>So how do we ride the wave? Well, I think Jesus was the best surfer this planet has ever known, better than other serious shredders like Buddha and maybe Ghandi and Lao Tse. (<em>don’t get all haywire here… this is one of the pleasant debates, like who’s better Willie Mays or Babe Ruth. It is not one of those crazy debates where we all grab our various scriptures and beat each other to death with them, OK? Play nice.</em>) So let’s ask Jesus how to ride the wave.</p>

<p>Jesus and Nicodemus, a Jewish religious leader, meet up. Rather than debate, Nicodemus seems genuinely interested, puzzled, sincere. Perhaps not. Perhaps he’s simply trying to trap Jesus or debate him, but we get no mention of it. We can only infer sincerity from the reading, because he only asks questions. And because Jesus offers sincere answers, I suspect Jesus is taking him seriously as well. Nicodemus wants to ride the same waves. He genuinely is trying to better understand God and learn whether Jesus is who they say he is, if his miracles are genuine, if indeed he is of God.</p>

<p>So, he says, “You must be a teacher because your miracles are of God.”</p>

<p>This is a key starting point. By the actions of Jesus alone, Nicodemus accepts he must be from God. In other words, he says the creative energy coming from Jesus looks, feels and produces what we in our limited understanding of such things can see as <em>divine</em>.</p>

<p>At the core of my belief I feel there are two energies in this world. First, a creative energy that sells to build, repair, heal, bless and bring beauty. It is love. Love cannot produce terrible things, no more than a sugar cane can produce salt. A thing evolves from its roots, from its core DNA. Love produces that which brings forth creative, sustainable energy, because the source of love is God herself. The result of his work, when God’s artistic talents are released in the world, is art, beauty, kindness, restoration, growth.</p>

<p>The second force is fueled by hate. It is at the root evil. This is rebellion against God. It can not be created by God. It is the result perhaps of God allowing humans choice. I don’t believe animals or plants or even sharks are evil. They are instinctual, living as part of the complex ecosystem of life. Same for hurricanes and tornadoes. But humans, and apparently angels as well, God allowed choice – free will. It is the only way we could love him. That choice allows evil to take root. The fruit of evil or hate is evident: destruction, death, violence, greed and lost.</p>

<p>This to me is the simplest way to see the hand of God. Where there is hate, it grows from the root of a destructive energy. Where there is love, it grows from the root of creative energy. One God opposes. The other she nurtures.</p>

<p>The mystery is why God allows it to continue. But God is the mystery. Her plan for this world is known to her alone. Any attempts to solve that are in fact trying to diminish God, to become God ourselves. It’s ultimately destructive, but I suspect a necessary part of the journey, like the many nasty crashes I’ve had trying to surf. It may even be how we learn to need faith. By faith we live the mystery.</p>

<p>So Nicodemus, a religious leader, affirms all I just said by saying in effect, “the source of your miracles are creative and healing, therefore from God.” But Jesus confounds him because he needs to know his desire to “explain God” is destined to fail. Jesus says these miracles are nothing, “You must be born again.”</p>

<p>If we stop there, the evangelicals win the day and we all have to start repeating the four spiritual laws as ordered.</p>

<p>But, Jesus doesn’t stop there at all. He has more to explain: “that which is born of the flesh is flesh, that born of the spirit is spirit.”</p>

<p>He’s explaining the energies. It seems he could just as easily say, that which grows from sugar is sweet, but that which grows from bitterness is bitter, or that which grows from love is creative, from hate is destructive.</p>

<p>Jesus understands he confounds us. He sees Nicodemus’ confusion. He basically says next, “it is a mystery” far more difficult to confine to four laws or rigid rules or white-knuckled obedience.</p>

<p>When I read this I think of surfing. No matter how many times someone has tried to “teach” me to surf, there really isn’t much they can say. “Do less… now jump up, no less, well a bit more than that…” as Paul Rudd tried to explain in the movie <em>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</em>.</p>

<p>It can’t be taught, really. And all throughout scripture God is telling us like he told Moses in Exodus 14, “do less.” Stand back. See me.</p>

<p>Well, God actually said, “The Lord will fight for you. You need only be still.”</p>

<p>Remember now, this is the most pivotal moment in Moses life, when the world’s greatest super power is hunting him down ready to create a genocide. Be still, he says.</p>

<p>Jesus continues the thread saying if you can’t believe Earthly things (like healings or water-to-wine miracles and such) how will you believe heavenly things (which requires faith!)?</p>

<p>So here’s the crux, about mid-way through this ancient conversation, right in the center of it. And what have we done? We pluck it out and bandy it carelessly about.</p>

<p>Perhaps your first memory verse, like mine was John 3:16. Read it. “For God so loved the world…” All the focus is always on the second part: “That he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.”</p>

<p>This is foundation of evangelicalism, this verse. Believe in Jesus. Be born again (by saying a prayer asking to be born again) and you’ll have everlasting life! Heaven insurance just like that. It’s all there in John 3, and similar ideas are found in Romans (the old Roman Road) by picking out similar verses.</p>

<p>But the emphasis of the whole story is on the source of all things, not the formula for Salvation. The verse starts with, “for God so loved the world.”</p>

<p>Love, the creative energy – flowing to the world, to push back evil, to reclaim broken people, to heal the wounds of our life here on earth — is the source, the way to true life, here “on Earth as it is in heaven,” as Jesus himself prayed.</p>

<p>It’s a wave, not an insurance policy and our surfboards are made of faith, such that if we set our minds to spiritual things, if we allow ourselves by the Spirit to be renewed by faith (not in a single prayer but over a lifetime spiritual journey, daily, over and over again, growing, being healed, creatively producing love and beauty in our own way) we too can be redeemed. Because the point of it all is right after that big centerpiece verse of John 3:16, in the often neglected John 3:17: “For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn (negative energy, destruction, hate) the world, but that through him we might be saved (the creative energy of God, her work of art, the Earth restored to its Garden of Eden beauty, where evil and hate are dispelled).</p>

<p>By the harvest our lives produce, we can know if we are part of the creative energy or the destructive energy. “Wrought by God” the scriptures say, which is like autographed by God. Our words are meaningless. The Kingdom of heaven isn’t a frat we get into by hazing and vows of loyalty. It’s by sensing who we are and having actions of grace flow from us that reveals our source. Do we produce or destroy? Love or hate? Build it up or tear it down? Spread kindness or dissension? All that comes from the light are true, signed by God. All in darkness are lies, destructive, evil.</p>

<p>Again, it’s a mystery Jesus knows our limits in knowing heavenly things. But he tells Nicodemus how to see what comes from God, what has been reclaimed by God, what he has Born Again (not us..).</p>

<p>One prayer isn’t a magical key to God’s kingdom. A journey of creative, positive, healing energy reveals our true heart. Our lives tell the story if we’ve been born again. Later in John 14, Jesus tells us how to find God. Follow the way. How? through truth. Seek the truth and you will find life, i.e., live in a moment of continual rebirth — born again, in the continual present.</p>

<p>The point is Evangelicals (disclaimer, I’m painting with a bad broom. Much of my spiritual journey has Godly evangelicals as the safe houses along my underground railroad journey. I love them to death, was once among them and lovingly ask them to stay on the journey of truth rather than guard a static dogma) often make the circle of God’s redemption smaller and smaller by limiting it only to those who say the right words. God seems to make it bigger and bigger, such that he wants to save “the world” (V.16-17). He wants to recreate his greatest work of art, the world, through love.</p>

<p>I’d guess there is no mention of what Nicodemus did because Jesus never asks him to do anything. No altar call. No prayer.  He leaves Nicodemus to continue his spiritual journey, because he knows the religious leader is seeking truth. He’ll find it. Perhaps he already has. His pursuits of truth, led him to Jesus, led him to ask great questions. He is already seeking. His journey doesn’t start or end with John 3. It continues throughout a lifetime.</p>

<p>I could be wrong. But 25 years of trying to ride spiritual waves, thankfully with more success than trying to surf convinces me I’m right enough. You can’t go wrong in the journey.</p>

<p>I’m going to ride those waves right up to the shore, no matter how many times they grind me into the beach and my son, I encourage you to grab a board and join me.</p>
