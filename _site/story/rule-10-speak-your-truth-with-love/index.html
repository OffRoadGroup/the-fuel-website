                <p class="big"><p>As I look back on my life, virtually every scene that makes me cringe starts with a lie. Perhaps every scene. Every red-faced moment. Every gut-wrenching failure. Every time I wish I could beg for a Mulligan: Deceit resides there.</p>

<p>I’m sure everyone has memories that still make them wince to think about? I have more than I wish. They become indelible, seared somehow on our souls. We recall them and feel the embarrassment or disapproval again as if the event was happening in that present moment all over again. The memory evokes the emotional response. That’s how stinkin’ important the truth is.</p>

<p>I recall one moment, all the way back when I was in first grade. I was the star in the Easter play. My first real crush, a blonde beauty named Jodie, was my co-star. I was in love! For several days leading up to the play she missed school due to an illness. Oh, how I missed her. Then the opportunity arose, a wonderful opportunity to be her knight in shining armor. The teacher asked if any of us lived by her. I shot my hand up. I agreed to drop off her homework. I was thrilled!</p>

<p>Until…</p>

<p>It dawned on me I had no idea where she lived. Well, I had a sort of idea. She had once told me where she lived. But I was so pie-eyed I barely listened. After school, vital papers in hand, I furiously tried to recall what she said as I informed my father of my top-level important, mission we needed to accomplish on the drive home.</p>

<p>“Turn here…Yeah..This is it.” I said, my father’s huge head looking down on me like I was an alien. “Uh…left here…I….think…”</p>

<p>“You think? I thought you knew where this girl lived?”</p>

<p>“I do!” I demanded.</p>

<p>I even went so far as to get out of the car, walk up to a random door, knock, and sheepishly ask for Jodie.</p>

<p>“Uh, there’s nobody named Jodie here,” the lady said kindly.</p>

<p>Soon we were headed home, her homework undelivered in my lap.</p>

<p>“Just tell the teacher you couldn’t find her house,” my dad said, shrugging it off, while my abject failure burned inside of me.</p>

<p>I should have known right then the magical power a beautiful girl could have over me and the trouble that would cause me in the years to come. Especially the next morning when my teacher asked me if Jodie got her homework.</p>

<p>“Yep, I dropped it off.” I lied.</p>

<p>I think back and want to smack that little dude. Idiot! I think now, and I thought then. The next two days I lived in mortal fear for the day Jodie returned and my failure would be tossed into the open for all to see. Jodie would know I was a liar. All would be lost!</p>

<p>The torment I put myself through was worse than the actual day of reckoning. Jodie was far behind on the school work, but the teacher believed some type of honest mistake had been made. Jodie still looked at me that way, unaware of my role in pushing her father behind. The play was a huge hit! I was a star! But my shame, my lie remains. And so I still remember it to this day.</p>

<p>Fast forward to my junior year in high school. I clashed with a favorite teacher, who put me in my place, embarrassing me in front of my class. I mumbled under my breath.</p>

<p>“You’re such an asshole,” I said.</p>

<p>Yep, he heard me.</p>

<p>“What did you call me?” he thundered.</p>

<p>Our clash now reached a new level. I knew it. I’d crossed the line and with one of the few teachers I respected and desperately wanted to respect me. I could have said, “I called you an asshole because you’re being one right now!” It would have been honest. I’d then take my lumps like a man. I’d have forgotten the episode by now as he likely has. But I didn’t.</p>

<p>I could have said, “I called you an asshole and regretted it as soon as it crossed my lips. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>It would have been most honest. It would have been mature. I might now still recall the episode but with a sense of inner growth. Instead, I didn’t.  I lied. I made up a stupid statement that I said something else to someone else. My lie scrawled across my blushed face as if written with a fat Sharpie. Nobody, I mean nobody, believed me. The teacher’s eyes burned my skin as surely as if he put a cigarette out upon my chest. I still feel the embarrassment. I cringe at my weakness.</p>

<p>And so it goes. Choice after choice missed to simply tell the truth, to extinguish the fuse, to salvage a bad situation. Jesus knew exactly what he was saying when he said, “The truth shall set you free.”</p>

<p>It’s so easy really. On one hand, a lie. Hard to conjure up, harder to remember, nearly impossible to forget unless you dull your conscience and darken your soul. On the other hand, truth. Lay it out there. A great cliché: let the chips fall where they may. It is what it is. In my experience, that approach costs far less in the long-term than the lie ever does.</p>

<p>But here’s the snag: An exhaustive study years ago in a book The Day America Told the Truth, discovered that 90 percent of Americans lie regularly. Ninety percent. Now that’s bondage. No wonder the truth can set you free.</p>

<p>But rule #10 isn’t just speak the truth, but it adds two vital words: Speak your truth, in love.</p>

<p>Why those two words? To be blunt, it’s the exact opposite of being “painfully honest,” which is popular these days. Have you noticed how many people talk about being painfully honest? And yet it seems a situational approach directed at someone. A far different approach comes when directed at oneself.</p>

<p>From my experience those being “painfully honest” are usually inflicting the pain on someone else, which is not the point of truthfulness.  Just because you know the truth, is it loving to offer it? Often we aren’t even asked when we rush to be “painfully honest” about someone else or about something that doesn’t even concern us. That’s not the truth, its gossip. And it’s insidious. “No comment,” is an effective, powerful form of the truth. Often it is the only loving response. At other times, the truth, spoken candidly and plainly is the most loving action available. Only with practice, with a sincere commitment to not be one of the 90 percent of liars in America can the correct response be discovered.</p>

<p>Now I know it seems I’m taking something pretty straightforward like “don’t lie,” and making it all kinds of complicated, but I suspect it’s necessary. If 90 percent of us do lie, then clearly the whole truthfulness lesson isn’t sinking in. It doesn’t take a scientist to look around at our world and see rivers of bullshit flooding over the banks of our lives. Daily reports of the very people who present themselves as our moral, political and economic leaders inundate us with their deceit. Our so-called heroes are often far more focused on their brand than their morality. Reality shows can’t be further from reality.</p>

<p>So let’s take one final pause and dwell for a moment on this very important rule #10. Notice I did not say, speak The truth.. I said speak your truth. This lesson not only calls for the discretion of speaking truthfully when appropriate, but it calls for discernment and humility to understand we alone are not arbiters of truth. We don’t hold the crystal ball. Rarely is truth absolute. Rarely is our experience the only experience or our understanding the only way to understand a situation. If we recognize our truth is simply what we best understand the truth to be, we leave plenty of room for the experiences of others. We become welcoming rather off-putting, humble rather than haughty.</p>

<p>I learned too late to use a vital weapon that can slay the devil of deceit within me. Let’s call it a holy pause. My parents used to say “think before you speak.” Give yourself a holy pause to consider your response. Far too often the first thought, the almost instinctual response is a lie. Amazing really. Lies just pour out of us if we let them. They are like weeds. Turn your back on them and they desecrate your landscape, woven into plants, creeping into the lawn, even so powerful as to push up through concrete! Yank them out and they break off, leaving roots to sprout deceit again. Till them asunder and they spread their seeds even deeper into the soil. The way to control weeds is to never let them grow. To pluck them out, one by one, from their roots the moment they sprout. The Holy pause, that moment to think before we speak is just the time. To stop the weeds from taking hold.</p>

<p>Obviously I could go on. Whole courses of philosophy are dedicated to the nature of truth. Debates have ranged for centuries as to whether there is an appropriate time to lie. We have spent lifetimes debating the extreme margins of truth in search of where it breaks down. But fortunately those extreme moments when a lie might be the best course are just that: extremely rare. And that’s not the problem for 90 percent of Americans. The basic, clear cut, day-to-day battle to be a truthful person has proved telling the truth is pretty straight forward and pretty difficult.</p>

<p>In the end if you remember one thing, remember this: It’s true when they say all a man has at times is his word. Guard yours well. The times you don’t will surely hang around to remind you, as uncomfortable as it may be.</p>
