                <p class="big"><p>From ancient philosophy to modern poetry serious thinkers have recognized that three is a crowd. That’s an oversimplification, of course, but it helps to consider the perpetual resistance people face when they go against the grain and learn to be comfortable alone.</p>

<p>Nietzsche had his disdain for “the mindless masses.” Religions speak of the narrow way to heaven or enlightenment or bliss. Rebels defy conformity. Ray Bradbury’s <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> spoke of the wandering few who kept their individualism alive through books. Plato allowed one person to escape the cave. Frost advocated the less traveled road. Bumper stickers preach individualism.</p>

<p>Take a good look around. The theme is ubiquitous. Go against the grain. Swim against the tide. Let your voice be heard. Then why, I often wonder, are people so damn afraid of being alone?</p>

<p>In grade schools, churches, statehouses and prisons, I have seen old and young alike desperate to fit in. Nothing in new social settings seems to cuts as deep as being apart from the crowd. As children we dread sitting alone at recess. Is that so different than politicians fearful of being black-balled by their “party” by voting on the grounds of conscience? Or is it that different from an inmate eating alone in the prison chow hall, or a person sitting alone at church for that matter? Or going to a movie by yourself, or to a movie, or just about any activity where our isolation sticks out and rubs against the grain of belonging?</p>

<p>This compulsive need to fit in exacts a tremendous toll in what appears to be the inevitable result of all of the above: We look to “the group” for what we think, how we act and who we like or dislike.</p>

<p>Consider a different path. Consider Rule #8: Enjoy your company. Learn to be comfortable alone.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s just modern American culture (it’s the only culture I know) but I see people of all stripes of life utterly desperate to avoid themselves. We evaluate our worth by our “friends” and “followers,” most of whom we never see in human form.</p>

<p>How many people once they’ve made up their mind to leave their significant other, first start up a new relationship to avoid the pain of separation? Men especially revolve between spouse, mistress and new object of desire as if promoting new trainees up the corporate ladder. I know I’ve done my share of trading one bad relationship for another.</p>

<p>Things have gotten so dysfunction in this Social Network Age that the American Psychological Association has <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/06/social-networking.aspx">addressed a new phenoma</a>, one called “alone in a crowd.” The story states that despite a proliferation of online social engagement, people are more isolated than ever, eroding our ability to live in a healthy manner when offline.</p>

<p>We are a social creature. We can’t avoid the genetic coding within us that seeks relationships to a greater or lesser degree. We are fathers, sons, uncle’s nephews, brothers, cousins, lovers and friends at all times. But this swallows our identity when not forced into proper prospective. Instead of knowing ourself and offering our best self to the world, we become bland, one-dimensional chameleons, determined to fit in. We live without leaving fingerprints on the world; instead we look like someone who acid washed those prints to become completely void of uniqueness.</p>

<p>A existential psychologist named Irwin Yalom greatly influenced my thinking back in my 20s as I struggled to understand who I was and who I wanted to be.  Fundamental to our own mental health is the acceptance of our individualism despite our desire for social acceptance. We are born alone and die alone, Yalom wrote. It can’t be avoided. In between we must accept the reality that try as we might, no one person, family or group will ever truly know us. They can’t live inside our skin as much as we try to fabricate it. Empathy, listening and caring remain important ways to connect with another human being, but they have their limits. At the end of the day, and at the end of our life we are alone.</p>

<p>So it would seem to me life will be more enjoyable and manageable if only we’d learn to enjoy our company. If you don’t like yourself, you are like the episode of <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> where two Siamese twins want to be separated because they are sick of each other!</p>

<p>Robert Parker’s Spenser P.I. mysteries proved insightful for me over the years. Spenser is an iconic figure of individualism. He lives by his moral code. He values others, loves just a few, but relies on himself. He learns to cook well even though many nights he is making dinner for one. Why not? If you are alone shouldn’t you still eat well?</p>

<p>As an introvert and someone who had a deeply neurotic ingrained intolerance for authority I have spent a lifetime fighting “the masses.” I’m a back row guy. I eat alone in cafeterias. I shove away “the crowd.” Yet only in the last few years did I stop my own desperate search to belong, if that meant a small exclusive circle of my choosing outside of the mindless masses yet still comfortably protected from myself. Only in recent years did I grow “comfortable in my own skin.” I learned to be comfortable alone, as opposed to forcefully isolated. Contained.</p>

<p>I feel lonely at times. I still accept the small shiver of fear when I stare at my isolation in its purest form knowing I was born alone and will die alone and I can’t do a thing to change it. But I am at least in company I enjoy now. By being OK with being alone, I’m better around those I love. I can relate to them more honestly instead of desperately seeking to grab from them the balm to heal my aching isolation. By being better alone, I’m far better around others.</p>

<p>And those masses? The bumper stickers and philosophers and authors and poets are mostly right. Be wary. Be wary.</p>
