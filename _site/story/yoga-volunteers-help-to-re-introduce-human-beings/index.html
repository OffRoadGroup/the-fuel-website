                <p class="big"><p>I invited John to yoga shortly after he arrived back to prison for another short sentence. John had treated me well when I first arrived at the state pen. He had spent more than 20 years in places far worse than that, places like Leavenworth and Bloody Beaumont, federal prisons that are known by reputation and depravity. The state pen seemed plenty enough depraved for me. John’s guidance proved critical, not just to adapting, but to navigating my entire journey through Criminal U.</p>

<p>When John came back I had a chance to repay him. He was now off balance, the first time he’d ever been to a minimum-security prison. I had been at this particular prison a while and had established myself. I could help get him settled in a foreign environment just as he had once done for me.</p>

<p>Minimum-security prison can be very tough on those used to places like John had been. Mentally, the lack of familiarity had John what I call “running hot.” Anxiety creased his brow. His temper ran like a revved engine. Other inmates saw him flash often enough to keep a wide distance.</p>

<p>That’s why I invited him to yoga. Nothing– not visits, not letters and calls home, not prayer, nothing — had helped me more on a week-to-week basis than the 90-minute yoga class offered by two volunteers each week. When they started the program, I was there the first day. I was there every single week for nearly 18 months until the week I went home. I still talk to my yoga teacher. He remains one of the angel’s God sent my way, light sent into a dark place, week after week.</p>

<p>John came to the class and soon was sweating, breathing hard, struggling to keep up despite being a guy who had always worked hard to stay in shape. The effort surprised him. When the class started to wind down, Yoga Jim as I called him, invited us to “stretch out for savasana” as he did at the end of every class.  We lie on our back, perfectly still, eyes closed (something you just never ever did in prison other than on our bunk). For ten minutes of guided meditation, the prison faded away. Peace floated in. As we ended, I felt once again, ready for the rest of the week.</p>

<p>I met John on the way out. Tears stained his face. His body looked like melting butter. A tremendous weight of something few would ever understand just dropped off of him.</p>

<p>“I’ve never experienced anything like that,” he told me quietly. “I’ve never… uh… I just felt calm for the first time in more than twenty years.”</p>

<p>Yoga in prisons is a godsend. It’s virtually free, almost always led by outside volunteers conducting service. It costs prisons nothing other than to provide space.</p>

<p>Yet far too often it isn’t available. Or in places like the state pen, the waiting list takes a year or two at the least just to get in the class. Yoga Jim and his helper Tanya — herself a retired counselor in the Department of Corrections — are the only teachers covering three prisons. Two people volunteering time have touched hundreds of hardened men in ways that no state program could. I’ve experienced it. I’ve seen it in others. I’ve watched the change in men as they come to do something they never thought they would.</p>

<p>I was first taught yoga by my cellie at the state pen. We couldn’t get into the class, so we’d go out on the yard and face the 30-foot walls with snipers perched above and do our sun salutations. It was the only time in prison I turned my back on other inmates and could care less what they said or did.</p>

<p>My cellie was doing ten years. He was hardened, a man with a violent pass and trigger temper. He’d say often how the industrialized prison system had been intent on crushing him. Yoga had become a way for him to feel human again. He taught me every other day. His only challenge to me was that I be willing to serve others as he served me. If they asked, he wanted me to share what he taught me.</p>

<p>Months later I moved to a different prison. I’d head out to the yard and continue my yoga practice. Soon after I arrived the yoga class needed someone new to lead the poses. I knew only what my cellie had taught me. I’d never been to a real class before. But I did as I promised I would and agreed to lead the class. More than 40 different men learned what my cellie taught me. More lives were changed. I saw it with my own eyes. And it didn’t cost the state a cent.</p>

<p>The <em>Texas Tribune</em> ran <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/us/if-the-sun-salutation-has-to-fit-into-a-cell.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">a story</a> about a similar program. <a href="http://convictionyoga.com/index.html">Conviction Yoga</a>, operated by a 48-year-old lawyer in Texas, began just this past summer. Jim Freeman (another Yoga Jim!) spends about $300 a week driving to four prisons around Austin. The state only has to open its doors and provide a space.</p>

<p>Freeman told the newspaper what I heard from Yoga Jim and Tanya countless times.</p>

<p>“I just see them as men,” Freeman said of the inmates. “And men that are starving for something.”</p>

<p>The chaplain at a prison Freeman conducts his classes said the corrections officers noticed better behavior from “those who took part in spiritual programs that gave them a chance to exercise,” the newspaper reported.</p>

<p>Likewise, my teachers Yoga Jim and Tanya would remind us at least once a month that we were human beings.</p>

<p>“When you walk through those doors you are not an inmate. You are a yoga student. You are not the crime that brought you here,” they’d say.</p>

<p>For men with “INMATE” stamped to their chest, back and legs, it was a powerful reminder.</p>

<p>Tanya would also challenge us, by asking, “Who are you going to introduce to the world when you walk out that gate?”</p>

<p>I like who I introduced to the world. Those around me tell me they like the person I introduced to them as well. I worked hard at who I would be. I worked hard at recovery. I still do. But I give a lot of credit to these two angels who taught me yoga.</p>

<p>I like seeing the transformation in people like John and my friend Charly and many others who simply had the opportunity to do a little yoga in prison.</p>

<p>Rehabilitating inmates is a daunting challenge. Far more will relapse, commit more crimes and return to prison than those that will turn their first enrollment at Criminal U into a solitary experience. But with so many programs like Conviction Yoga in Texas, or the work of simple volunteers in Oregon showing real progress, why can’t we focus instead on what we can do and what helps a little instead of dwelling on what we can’t and all that is wrong with those who live their lives behind the bars and barbed wires of America prisons?</p>
