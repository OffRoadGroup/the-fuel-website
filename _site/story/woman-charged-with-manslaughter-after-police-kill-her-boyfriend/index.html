                <p class="big"><p>I’ve taken this story out for a test run a few times just to see what the response will be. I do this from time to time, just to gauge a little slice of reader reaction to what I write. I tried this one three times. All three had the <em>exact same response</em>.</p>

<p>You try:</p>

<p>“A 21-year-old woman, Regan Jelks, was riding in a car with her boyfriend, Taemarr Walker, when they came upon a police car with its lights on tending to an abandoned vehicle. A tow truck blocked the road. The boyfriend tried to pass and drove into a ditch, attracting the attention of the officer. As he approached the car, the officer said he saw a gun. A war of words broke out with the police officer telling the man several times to put his hand where he could see them. When Walker lunged for a gun, the officer shot and killed him. The woman was eventually pulled from the car screaming ‘Please don’t kill me.’ Her family says she had gun powder residue and wounds from the shattered glass on her face from the gun shots. Police cuffed her without giving her medical assistance and shoved her into a police car,” I say.</p>

<p>“She is now being charged with involuntary manslaughter of her boyfriend,” I say.</p>

<p>What’s your response?</p>

<p>All three I asked said the same thing: “How can they do that?”</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.yourblackworld.net/2014/04/black-news/woman-charged-for-de%CE%B1th-of-her-boyfriend-who-police-sh%CE%BFt-and-k%CE%B9lled/">This one is a head scratcher</a>. No, actually, as I re-think it, it’s not a head scratcher at all. It’s an abomination.</p>

<p>Police issued a six page statement about the killing of Walker– a known gang member in Ohio who was wearing latex gloves carrying a rifle and a handgun at the time of his death. A nearby bar had closed down early because Walker had threatened to shoot the place up. Police clearly believe he was headed that way.</p>

<p>But the same report mentioned only that Jelks was being charged some six months after the incident. It also said it would offer no further information until the case is resolved. In other words, they’ll use the media to clear the name of their police officer but don’t expect us to explain our work to you — the very taxpayers who pay our salaries.</p>

<p>Police also now see Jelks as an accomplice. They had her arrested in Detroit and brought back to Ohio. They made her walk the shackled perp walk to her arraignment.</p>

<p>Which still begs the question how do you charge her with involuntary manslaughter?</p>

<p>This is how police work these days. They twist the laws they are sworn to uphold to coerce a maximum sentence. The threat then makes the person — in this case Jelks, who her family says has no prior criminal convictions — scared enough to play ball.</p>

<p>The gun charges against Jelks carry a maximum sentence of 18 months, according to the police report. The manslaughter ratchets that up to 11 years. Which do you think is more scary? Which do you think will force a plea deal and avoid having to take this crappy case before a jury?</p>

<p>A local story after Jelks arraignment offered a headline that said the charges were now more clear.</p>

<p>“The involuntary-manslaughter charge says Jelks caused the death of Walker ‘as a proximate result of … committing or attempting to commit’ the felony of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle,” .</p>

<p>This of course explains very little. The firearms in the car weren’t hers. There has been no evidence cited that her fingerprints were on the gun. The guns were not used in the killing of her boyfriend. The police officer’s gun did that.</p>

<p>So why bother? That’s the question. Why pull this gal with few ties to the area back on such spurious charges? Why incur the costs?</p>

<p>Here you have to read between the lines a bit. In the aftermath of this shooting, gang violence escalated to the point, “Following the shοoting, the city of Warren experienced a spree of violence where some actions were thought to be in retaliation to the shooting. Warren Mayor Doug Franklin enlisted the help of the Ohio State Highway Patrol to monitor the streets and called for peace in the city.” .</p>

<p>But it gets even clearer at the bottom of the aforementioned news article, which stated: “Meanwhile, Walker’s older brother, TaShawn Walker, 26, of Baytown, Texas, was in Judge Kontos’ court Monday for a hearing on his murder charge in the death of Richard Rollison IV, 24, of Niles.</p>

<p>“Rollison was killed at a West Market Street gas station almost exactly one week after Taemarr Walker was killed.”</p>

<p>How convenient. A murder charge against the brother of Walker in the same court as Jelks, a brother being held in the same jail, where people talk and where desperate recorded phone calls are made and where scared people like Jelks will talk about big things like murders that she may know little about.</p>

<p>Suddenly the whole case against Jelks isn’t confusing at all.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/8dc35g">campaign to raise legal funds</a> for Jelks has been started. The family has raised $3,000 toward its goal of $7,000. More is likely needed because a good attorney can do more than any one else right now to throw a gear in the wheel that turns lives upside down with trumped up charges simply to coerce cooperation.</p>

<p>In a just system of justice, the end does not justify the means.</p>
