                <p class="big"><p>Speaking of love…If I am convinced of one thing it is that love can no more be controlled than the oceans can be silenced. Like waves that rip out and gather themselves and crash with energy back from which they just departed, love is part of the life force, movement and sustainability of Earth. It is sort of like nuclear energy – full of limitless power that makes it so very dangerous if not handled with care – but even more so. It is awesome and horrible, beautiful and treacherous, peace and terror combined. Love is our Fountain of Youth, our Mount of Transfiguration, a never-ending green flash, our Garden of Eden. It is the greatest of all renewable resources.</p>

<p>To fear love — and thus to step outside of it so as not to be overwhelmed by its power — is to remove yourself from the life cycle. At that moment death begins its work on you. Your pulse may take years to finally extinguish, but you are already a daily special for worms somewhere up ahead. To avoid love is to try to avoid the Sun.</p>

<p>So we fear love’s heat but crave its warmth and back in our God-mode (see rule 1), we seek a more controllable middle ground. Never is human folly as evident as when we opt for a middle ground when it comes to love. We convince ourselves love is a wild horse that simply must be broken, trained and corralled. Then it can be ridden, with us pulling the reins, perched atop of it without acknowledging how we have diminished it so.</p>

<p>Though such notions are comforting they remain folly. Love is no more likely to be harnessed and led by a bit in its mouth then God is willing to be nothing more than a genie in a bottle.  In my experience many of the same people who cook up such silly notions of God are the same ones who love as if they alone bear the rider’s crop. This is control, not love. Two more foreign concepts don’t exist. Oil and water mix more successfully, than love and control. God let us in on a little secret when so often He said He and love are one. Consider John 13:35: Jesus said that people would best know him by how his followers loved each other.</p>

<p>Think about that. Do you wonder like I do if Jesus wished he could take back that one
Somehow despite knowing what colossal screw-ups we are with love, God baked it into the bread anyway. Love is not part of the equation of life; love is the calculator. Love is not an ingredient; love is the bowl in which all of the other ingredients are mixed.</p>

<p>If you are going to truly live, you must wrestle with love despite knowing you stand the same chance of victory as Jacob did when he had the balls to grapple with God.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just do what you have to do knowing full well you’ll limp the rest of your life because of it.</p>

<p>So, love fully.</p>

<p>Anything less is a flimsy substitute, a zircon, a reduced-fat fraud. Love is the uncut diamond of purest quality. Don’t settle for less. Don’t offer less.</p>

<p>But….</p>

<p>Ah, But. There’s always a but, right?</p>

<p>I didn’t just attempt to explain energy so powerful that words do it an injustice because it was only a wonderful thing. You can’t dismiss love’s terrifying power. You can’t for a minute doubt it could consume you like the mortician’s oven. So the greatest caution must be used to love those worthy of you, to love those capable of loving you in return. Love fully yes, hell yes, but love slowly.</p>

<p>Approximations of love have their rightful place in this world. Romance is a delightful one. First kisses are all that, which is why so many storytellers focus on the first kiss rather than the ten-year anniversary. We call that falling in love because, again, we want love on a level where it’s manageable. But it is just romance, a nice, even exhilarating yet tiny subset of love. Because romance is so tame, you’d do well to enjoy it. It is a Labradoodle puppy compared to the roar of the lion of love. I wish you several first kisses and all the deliriously joyful butterflies in the stomach that come with it. Just enjoy with restraint on your heart. Don’t force love into places it is not properly prepared to bloom.</p>

<p>Sex is a subset of love, but not entirely. Some sex is nothing like love and is something sinister and odorous. At other times sex is a part of romance and provides comfort and pleasure. At times it is the antidote to an anxious heart or a struggling mind. Few things restore like the willing embrace of someone who cares.</p>

<p>But it is more than that too. I wouldn’t want anyone to live a life with all its trials and suffering and not experience the holy and miraculous transcendence in those rare times when sex flows from the source of genuine, unconditional and committed love. This is the stuff that creates music for lyrics and turns prose into poetry. This is the surfer on the crest of the monster wave.</p>

<p>If you love slowly, you are most apt to ride the dragon of love and not be scorched by the fire that flows from its nostrils. If you love slowly, you are most likely to have something of your own that is genuine and pure to offer as well.</p>

<p>Before we leave the notion of love and sex let me be clear that more often than not the two are confused rather than harmonically combined. They are often discordant notes, minor keys full of woe, choked in our collective neurosis, selfish needs and addictive motives. Though I can’t describe well when sex and love combine with the flow of the creative force of the world, I just know they do. And when they do for you, you’ll know. The sound is perfect pitch, four-part harmony, the music of angels.</p>

<p>This is the point where our society often jumps into the psychological quicksand of being a “good lover.” Of course, I have my own thoughts on that. I have spent a lot of time mulling, reading, pursuing the techniques of a confident lover, and I’d be remiss in not sharing that insight gained here, even when so many of the lessons come from such ridiculous failures that I still feel my face flush with embarrassment at the memory. But I do not wish in any way that sex, a small part of the awesome entity of love, cloud this rule. I’ll reserve further discussion down the road a bit when it is given a more humble, suitable place of importance. The music of angels is not one that keeps score from a judges’ table of how well you performed your moves. Trust me on that one.</p>

<p>Love fully… but slowly, and may you ride the monster waves now and again. ***** Your task in life is to love fully, albeit slowly. And that includes a great many relationships other than whoever will become your one true love.</p>

<p>In your life you will love friends, family, siblings and your parents, besides just your lovers, if you are to truly experience life as it is intended to be. All of these relationships require just as much tenacity as your one true love. All these perch you, like it or not, just as firmly in the crest of the wave and upon the back of the dragon — even more so if only because they are longer lasting relationships with roots back to your first fully human thoughts. Here you already know how painful love can be. You can already point to the scars and limps you’ve acquired from wrestling with the pure power of love. Yet the great challenge is to embrace this love, to accept it for all its accompanying difficulties and to fully surrender. You can no more amputate this love than you can chop off your head.</p>

<p>So stop and re-read all of what I’ve said about love, with these relationships in mind, as opposed to just sex and romance and love. It looks a bit different, right? Just let that settle for a minute.</p>

<p>Oh shit, right?</p>

<p>Exhausting, I’m sure. Can’t we just settle for holidays and occasional emails instead of genuine love of our family? Hmmm. To do so is to be diminished, to try to tame the horse. Ride the dragon. Feel the heat. Accept the burns. Because families are the people who can best love us despite all our flaws.</p>

<p>The whole rule still applies, even with family. Love fully, but slowly, even within this small circle of “family,” even as you form those few close friendships you hope will last a lifetime. This affords you some breathing room. You still must respect the power of love. Love slowly. Jesus said don’t cast your pearls before swine.</p>

<p>Learn to see the heart, not the words, not even temporary actions, of those you wish to love. When you see the heart of love, slowly reveal your own. The power to see beyond the failings of the moment or the peculiarities of the individual is the power to know someone heart to heart. To love fully. To move beyond the emotion of the moment.</p>

<p>At this point, slowly, you’ll begin to know and love those few people you are called to really love. God calls this unconditional love. It is a blessed thing to give and receive. Rare. A gem. It is not for the faint of heart. But it is very worth it.</p>
