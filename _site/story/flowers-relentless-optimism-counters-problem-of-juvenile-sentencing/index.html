                <p class="big"><p>I’ve been corresponding with a man who has been in prison for nearly two decades. He has never known a day of adulthood spent outside the barbed wires and bars of America’s prisons. He was part of a great wave of sentencing that lowered the rate of adulthood in our culture for only one exception: to try children as adults and lock them up forever.</p>

<p>This man put a human face — a relentlessly optimistic face– on the problem of juvenile sentencing in this country.</p>

<p>This man’s name is Halim Flowers and before I tell you about him, let me tell you about a boy named Kahton Anderson who walked onto a bus and shot the wrong guy. As best we can tell it was an act of gang violence, likely ordered from an adult who this boy feared. We don’t know why it happened, we only know an innocent bystander was killed and now Anderson will be tried as an adult.</p>

<p>As the <em>New York Times</em> reported, this type of sentencing arose back when Flowers was a boy, in response to academic predictions that “superpredators,” youths in gang (in other words, black youths) would spill innocent blood like never seen before. It didn’t happen.</p>

<p>Crime actually decreased for those under 18 dramatically. But the sentencing laws enacted on the basis of this unrealized fear did happen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It energized a movement, as one state after another enacted laws making it possible to try children as young as 13 or 14 as adults. (New York had such a law even earlier, and it is now being applied to Kahton Anderson.) Many hundreds of juveniles were sent to prison for life, though in the last few years the United States Supreme Court has ruled that such sentences must not be automatic, even in murder cases. Individual circumstances and possible mitigating factors should be weighed, the justices said.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>via <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/politics/killing-on-bus-recalls-superpredator-threat-of-90s.html?hp">When Youth Violence Spurred ‘Superpredator’ Fear – NYTimes.com</a>.</p>

<p>Legally children under the age of 18 cannot give consent to anything. They simply are not responsible adults by the definition of the law. But if they murder someone, or in the case of Flowers, hang around someone who murders someone, they can be deemed adults so they can spend the rest of their lives in a place that will treat them like children, horrifically poorly treated children, but children nonetheless.</p>

<p>This is the rite of passage in American society. Wonderful tradition, isn’t it? This is exactly why I wrote Rules 101 for my son on his 18th birthday. We are desperate for cogent thinking that goes beyond crime and punishment.</p>

<p>Now let me tell you about Halim Flowers, a relentlessly positive inmate who sets the standard for reform. Or better yet, let someone who knows him better than I tell you, criminal justice consultant Nikki Elliot:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Halim Flowers is a beautiful and talented soul who made a mistake as a 16 year-old teenager and who was sentenced to 30 years to Life for it. Since those long 17 years ago, Halim has turned his trials and tribulations into learning and turning totally around from his mistakes years ago. His metamorphosis has transformed into a motivational speaker, teacher, financial advisor, author of five books, poet, life coach and so much more. Halim is also the special guest host on Youtube videos for National Poetry Month and, he never ceases to amaze me and so many others with his loving heart, beautiful mind and talented soul in continuing to write worldly wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a list of his books (available on Amazon.com):
•	<em>A Reason To Breathe</em>
•	<em>A Reason To Breathe Volume II: Til My Last Breath!</em>
•	Buried Alive: Dead Men Do Talk
•	<em>Mind Over Matter</em>
•	<em>What Our Fathers Never Told Us</em></p>

<p>Researching even further, I saw on a website named “Access Legal Aide” where Halim had written letters from the “inside” and which are posted on that site. All of his letters were soulfully, articulately, and motivationally written. One letter in particular stood further out to me. Please see an excerpt from this letter below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I was convicted of aiding and abetting a murder. I was not charged as the shooter, just my presence along with the commission of the felony was enough to secure me a mandatory 30 years to life sentence. I was only sixteen at the time of my offense. During my incarceration, I have attended college, acquired numerous vocational trades, mentored younger prisoners, counseled suicidal inmates, and I have accepted responsibility for my past destructive actions and continue to demonstrate sincere remorse through my efforts to avoid violence and to help others from preying on weaker inmates. I have seen many of my ‘non-violent’ prisoner peers come in and out of prison during my 16 years of incarceration. Just because I was a part of a violent offense, am I not deserving of a second chance to see if I can be a mature law-abiding ‘adult’ citizen in society or shall I be forever condemned for my bad choices that I made as a minor?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Halim is also currently in the process of working with the nonprofit organization “Think Outside The Cell” in New York City on their Civic Duty Initiative to help inmates perform and do positive deeds for people in society. This Civic Duty Initiative program recently sponsored the first ever gun-buy-back funded by inmates in a New York State prison. Furthermore, Halim is planning to work with Think Outside the Cell on a book based on how inmates can give back to their communities positively while serving their sentences in prison.</p>

<p>Please support Halim in his prosperity and allow his heart, wisdom, experience, teachings, and passion to continue helping so many; while at the same time helping yourself to gain knowledge, transition, and dedication that you never knew you had until reading Halim’s life-changing books.</p>
