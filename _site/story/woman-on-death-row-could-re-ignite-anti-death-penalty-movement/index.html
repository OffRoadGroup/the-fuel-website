                <p class="big"><p>I didn’t find God in prison. I took Her there with me. We just got reunited in a badly needed way.</p>

<p>But as a February <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/28/us/a-death-row-inmate-finds-common-ground-with-theologians.html?_r=0">New York Times article</a> on Kelly Gissendaner noted, “a lot of convicted felons find God in prison.” This reuniting or conversion or rapprochement of spirituality tends to be viewed at best cautiously and at worst cynically.</p>

<p>In most cases I think it best to keep such things close to the heart, like all good loving relationships. It rarely helps to talk of such intimacies between a “convicted felon” and God. Why bother, I think? I prefer to live the relationship out and leave the judgement of its veracity to others.</p>

<p>Kelly Gissendaner doesn’t have that option. She is literally fighting for her life and those fighting hardest on her behalf are largely doing so because of her prison conversion.</p>

<p>I can relate to this woman, a “friend of theologians” having studied many of the same subjects and courses–including Jurgen Moltmann and Deitrich Bonhoeffer–during my years in seminary. Her education, spiritual growth and personal practice go far beyond the so-called “prison conversion” story that causes eyes to roll. She is an example of what it means to truly believe in faith and forgiveness:</p>

<p>Hopefully though, the conversation will move past faith and toward justice, from forgiveness to reform. Because frankly, the anti-death penalty effort in this country needs a renewed burst of energy and focus. As Criminal U’s friend and Death Row inmate Reggie Clemons says, “I wonder what happened to the anti-death penalty movement?”</p>

<p>Few could deny that the attention, upheaval and outspoken opposition to Gissendaner’s execution is solely based on two factors: she is a woman and she is a devout Christian whose conversion in prison has been lived out faithfully and enthusiastically for years behind the bars and barbed wires of Georgia’s death row.</p>

<p>Some are calling a snowstorm and a cloudy drug acts of a benevolent, loving, forgiving God because both <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/02/ga-woman-put-to-death-in-husbands-murder/24286007/">delayed Gissendaner’s execution</a> in the final hours in recent days.</p>

<p>Twice she has woken up on the morning of her arrest only to twice be delayed. Sister Helen Prejean, of Dead Man Walking fame, tweeted out that this was torture, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Evangelical Christians are calling for the courts to commute her sentence to be life in prison. Barring a dramatic shift in state politics, the only legal option she has left is if the U.S. Supreme Court stays the next execution date to consider her appeal, which the court did last month in the still lingering case of Les Bower.</p>

<p>Conservative Christians tend to be the strongest defenders of the death penalty, but many in this case point to the dramatic changes Gissendaner has made as evidence that people can change and be rehabilitated. Having spent time with many convicted killers, having meals, walking prison years, I know without a doubt this to be true, God or not.</p>

<p>Gissandaner’s case may lead to important conversations from people of faith on both sides of this issue that could either severely limit the death penalty or find a common ground on the need for far more regulation of the murky, secretive and disparate ways we execute in this country. Justice, it would seem, would be a common ground that people of faith can stand on for horribly needed reform. We know innocent people are on death row. We see them walking free after being exonerated. We know people like Les Bower and Reggie Clemons have legal issues that cause considerable cause for doubt, but both have been just days — or even hours away — from their executions. We know the process is flawed; we’ve seen horribly “botched” executions that caused terrible suffering.</p>

<p>We know this isn’t working.</p>

<p>Yet  a handful of states continue to execute regularly. So every case is critical, including Gissendaner who may just have God sending storms and ruining drugs on her behalf.</p>

<p>But beyond the faith and forgiveness issue, let’s consider again the justice issue.</p>

<p>Is it just that the actual murderer of Gissendaner’s husband took a plea deal and could be paroled as early as 2023. Yet Gissendaner who encouraged the act but did not commit it only asks to be commuted to a life sentence. Is this disparity just?</p>

<p>Is it just to remove a model prisoner who helps inculcate an often inhumane prison environment with grace and love a benefit to society bent on needed prison reform? So much work of reform must be done inside prisons if the work we do outside is to be effective. Is society served by this execution?</p>

<p>Executions model deterrents in theory to other would-be murderers. But does rehabilitation, in this case evident to many people who know Gissendaner, deserve to model potential re-sentencing that are still acts of justice, like life in prison over a death penalty?</p>

<p>The anti-death penalty needs focus. People of faith need God-centered dialogue. True reform must come from new insights with new focus on societal needs and genuine justice, not political objectives that fuel executions in this country.</p>

<p>Perhaps God is moving in this case to stay the executioner’s hand. By all rights if anyone deserve a degree of leniency Kelly Gissandaner is it. But let’s let the uproar lead to dialogue, which leads to common points of agreement from which the plant of reform can be built.</p>

<p>Anti-death penalty advocates: Are you listening? The work here in Georgia is only starting. We need to stay the course.</p>
