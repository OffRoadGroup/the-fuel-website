                <p class="big"><p>For years I had a love/hate relationship with New Year’s Eve. Now it’s pretty much just hate. But that’s changing. The love is rising again. Sounds complicated, I know, or perhaps just schizophrenic. But let me explain.</p>

<p>Like most reckless alcoholics, I loved New Year’s Eve, a time of unabashed partying where most everyone else drank like I usually did. I could throw off my normal neurotic need to show how together I was when I drank – I lived in fear that folks would realize my happy-go-lucking heavy drinking was an actual problem—and let it all go off the rails for a night. That was the love part of the equation.</p>

<p>Then the reality arrived. Things rarely turned out as I hoped. Year after year I discovered a litany of failed of expectations. New Year’s Day hangovers usually far outweighed the New Year’s Eve frivolity. As the countdown commenced and those seconds ticked away, a dark awareness of my unhappiness, my unfulfillment, my disappointment with the year (years) just passed and lack of hope for the year coming despite all the false, drunken bravado I could muster, set in. That was the hate part.</p>

<p>A few times the hate spilled over into consciousness, disrupting the love before the big ball in Times Square began its famous descent. In 1993’s final moments and again in 2007, my depression spilled into words on a page, chronicling my bitterness, sadness and discontent precisely at a time when I was supposed to be filled with hope and expectation for the coming year. Most years I just drank it away.</p>

<p>When I got sober, I learned to just hate New Year’s Eve. I spent each of the first four years in a deep sleep by the time midnight came, a Grinch that stole the Eve or some such foul creature.</p>

<p>Then I began to think a bit more about the whole thing. Isn’t it ironic that the one holiday dedicated to the idea of being wholly present in the moment – to actually watch and celebrate a ticking clock – is also the holiday that we see the need to get blindly drunk? A coincidence? I don’t think so. Because I finally realized that the present moment scares the living shit out of us.</p>

<p>So with that vote of confidence, allow me to introduce Rule #6: Be present.</p>

<p>Thrilling right? Yeah, I didn’t think so. But necessary, very necessary.</p>

<p>You might recall the Adam Sandler movie where he finds a remote control that allows him to fast-forward through the parts of his life that bother him. He is overjoyed by the discovery (after the requisite funny freak-out scene in these formulaic comedies). Soon he hits the fast-forward through his wife’s conversations and daily chores and time at work. It’s great, until the remote basically takes over, using his preferences as a pattern for auto-zoom. Before he can stop the madness he is old and bitter and alone and dying. Hilarious, right? But who would have thought Adam Sandler would hit on an idea of Eastern spirituality and capture it in a goofy movie?</p>

<p>For centuries, Eastern writings have challenged the intense need in all of us to zoom through the parts of our lives that are most uncomfortable. The gurus figured out that our avoidance hinders our humanity. They understood that to truly live this life to the fullest one must live it in the moment. They challenge us to be present.</p>

<p>Present is, in fact, like watching a ticking clock, fully aware that each tick is one tick closer to the end. This existential certainty, that we will die, is a significant rite of passage, a test. We learn to embrace the life we have left rather than fearfully try to create more.</p>

<p>Too often we fail the test. We live our entire lives in the future tense. We build security for the future. We look to a future time when we’ll be happy. We strive for a future job, a future relationship, a future success or standing. We are perpetually striving, yet missing the moments that pile upon each other in a massive heap of missed opportunities for life. We invest time instead of live it as the gift given to us that it really is.</p>

<p>Can we add any moment to our life through this investment?</p>

<p>One of the best books I have ever read is The Sacrament of the Present Moment, by Jean-Pierre De Caussade, a 17th century French priest. It’s the only work of his that remains to this day. He likely didn’t intend it to be a book, but rather it was compiled as a series of instructions for the nuns in his care. In these scant 80 or so pages is a golden recipe for life. De Caussade wrote (in what must have seemed heretical at the time) that all the sacraments of the church were meaningless compared to the sacrament of the present moment. Our lives, he said, could be properly defined by nothing more than living in the moment, aware of the grace of God that is sufficient for all. The golden wisdom of the book is a motherlode, sentences upon sentences compiled as a collection of wealth. Consider: “Follow your path without a map, not knowing the way, and all will be revealed to you.”</p>

<p>For a culture that expends so much of our life’s moments and internal energy focused on a future goal, how freeing it is to simply acknowledge there is no map. We don’t know what the future holds, so we are free… FREE… to live this moment to its fullest.</p>

<p>Perhaps among all the things I write about in this book, no rule will be more difficult. Its difficulty however lies within us. We simply stop struggling with the future and become present, which quite ironically is the easiest thing ever once you stop struggling so hard. Within that present, the eternal present, philosophers call it, we find inestimable joy. Perhaps for the first time in our lives we really live.</p>

<p>Try it. Take a day and dedicate to live it. Become a fan of your own life, as if watching your own reality show instead of trying to write, star, produce and direct it. It may be a day that changes your life. More likely though it will offer you a glimpse of what your life can be. A thousand more times you’ll race ahead, rushing back into the insanity and comfort of life lived in the future tense. But hopefully, more and more you’ll stop and pause and return to the peaceful present. Do it enough and you might just discover how to truly live your life.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be fair or accurate to deny that the present, frankly, sucks more often than not. If it were so wonderful why wouldn’t we just soak it in? Those present moments can be terrifying. The anxiety we work so hard to quash rushes in like a tide. We see ourselves in truth: the fat, the poverty, the disappointment, the compromises, the debauchery, the pain. This truth, this present moment, is what scares the shit out of us every New Year’s Eve. How any of us can survive this without getting shit-faced amazes me really.</p>

<p>But… but, if we take a breath and let the fear rush on by, the true sweetness of the present begins to emerge. For me it was like a wildfire loosed upon the dry, neglected forest of my soul. It ran hot and wild and destructively laid waste to all the fiction about myself I created and propped up with heavy, steady doses of booze. I could do nothing but let it burn. But in the dark ash of all that destruction, my present moment began to bloom. Pushing up new through the soot were green sprouts of truth. My truth. My life. The one I was supposed to live all along.</p>

<p>And that my son, is why this rule is so very, very important.</p>

<p>I’ll conclude with true wisdom, again from De Caussade and a single wish: May you find the riches beyond your wildest dreams.</p>

<p>“The present moment holds infinite riches beyond your wildest dreams but you will only enjoy them to the extent of your faith and love.”</p>
