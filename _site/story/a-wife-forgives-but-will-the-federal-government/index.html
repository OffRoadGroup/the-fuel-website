<p>Human beings are not disposal, we are finding out. The system failed Kevin Gobert, a first-time, non-violent, drug offender who was sentenced for 20 years. Twenty years! Kevin made mistakes, but this type of sentence is exactly what has led to our country’s epidemic of mass incarceration. It needs to be changed.</p>

<p>For now, let me introduce you to Kevin’s amazing wife, Stephanie Allen-Gobert, a writer for yourblackworld.net. And listen to her own thoughts on all that is happening with her during this most difficult time of her life:</p>

<p>In or out…This is what Loves About!
By Stephanie Allen-Gobert</p>

<p>Growing up like many other young girls, I had dreams of a fairy tale wedding, a wedding with all the trimmings: a beautiful white dress, huge chapel, flawless bridesmaids, a huge layered cake, ice sculptors of me and my new husband, caterers running and at my beckon call, my children and family dressed so elegant and lovely, so many family members and friends. I finally make it to the alter and there stands the man of my dreams, Kevin Gobert, my high-school sweetheart. He is smiling from ear to ear! He is so happy, this is a day the Lord has made…he kisses his bride (me) and we live happily ever after.</p>

<p>Sounds amazing huh? And I did marry the man of my dreams. But it hasn’t always been a fairy tale.</p>

<p>We’ve had our struggles and life’s ups and downs that we have conquered. We have many more things we are still trying to conquer.</p>

<p>I grew up in the great state of Texas. I have been with my husband for about 22 years and still counting. We have two beautiful children, Kierra 20, who is attending school and will become a dentist upon graduation and JaKobe, 14, who has plans on playing in the NBA and becoming an engineer. I came from a pretty big family all of us were closely raised by a grandmother, who did not play around in regards to her grandchildren. My real mom died when I was eight months in a car accident and my father, who is deceased, suffered from a drug addiction my entire life. I met Kevin in the tenth grade. We have been together on and off since. Mostly on never fully off.</p>

<p>My husband has been there for me, my family, other families and his family for as long as I have known him. He is always kind, caring, and loving. I don’t want this story to be all mushy, but this is the character of who I married.</p>

<p>He is also flawed. As his wife, I have dealt with a lot of his faults and mistakes. No marriage is without struggles or troubles. I have had a lot of lonely and sleepless nights.</p>

<p>Two major issues have affected our marriage severely and almost caused a divorce. The first was finding out about years of my husband and his infidelity — where two children were conceived. The turmoil a woman feels when all that comes to light, I don’t think any man but God understands. It is very hurtful. But through prayer, fasting, counseling, and me just being still and listening to what God wanted me to do, we made it through that. I forgave my husband, but he can tell you, there are times I never let him forget what he did! (I’m praying on that, I am human…) Despite the pain, I now have two beautiful step-kids, Elijah and Jade.</p>

<p>The second major issue was my husband ended up in federal prison. I will never forget that day, when I heard that aggressive knock on my door.  I went downstairs. A swarm of law enforcement types said, “We are here to pick up Kevin Gobert.”</p>

<p>Heart breaking, I was so thankful, my children were not home to see their father carried away in handcuffs. The mental anguish I don’t think they could handle. Kevin bailed out and we went through more than three years of court appearances, litigation, meetings, leg-monitoring meetings, monthly home visits, and pretrial hearings. Finally, on Oct. 2, 2012 my husband was sentenced. He was given 240 months!</p>

<p>My heart just dropped…</p>

<p>How could a man — so generous, non violent, first-time incarcerated, almost 40 years old, with letters from key individuals who testified on his character, his honesty, his help in crucial matters, a father, MY husband, a son, a brother, a friend, a man of God now, a man who gave to the homeless faithfully, participated in school drives for children, a CHANGED MAN — be given this much time!</p>

<p>How does a mother explain to her children, “Kierra, you’re 18 now, you might see your dad home when you are about 40 years old; JaKobe, your dad will probably miss all your high school, college and professional basketball games? It heart wrenching, and I know many wives, children, and families deal with this on a daily basis along with me and my family.</p>

<p>So you might ask, “What makes my situation different than what million of wives go through” What makes me so “special?” Honestly, nothing! I am just another wife who is forced to deal with a system that is messed up all around. But I am being obedient to what God just told me and put on my heart to share with the world; this is what He told me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Write. They will listen and change will come; I’m bringing Kevin home to you guys and it ‘ain’t’ going take no 240 months! You do what I am asking of you because I see families struggling, the brokenness families are feeling when one parent is taken away from the home.</p>

  <p>“I want you, Stephanie, to touch the hearts of women who face same situation, and let them know I have not forgotten about them or their spouses. Prayer still works! I also want you to let your story ignite their faith, so they can see an individual whose husband has taken her through a lot but they managed to pray and get through and that change is coming!</p>

  <p>“I never sleep or slumber, I’m in the ear of President Obama to let my people go, I’m talking to crooked prosecutors who want to punish unjust, I’m speaking to Attorney General Eric Holder. I want to bring back an amazing bible verse, 1 Corinthians 13:13, that says, ‘But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of  these is love,’</p>

  <p>“You and Kevin, Stephanie, continue to show the world, that in or out…this is what love is about!”</p>
