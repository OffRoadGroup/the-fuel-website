  <p>The well-funded and high-profile innovative effort of Defy Ventures taps into the disaffected millions of formerly incarcerated adults an offers an intriguing post-conviction solution.</p>

  <p>Spun off from one of the most successful rehabilitation programs in the country, with years of dramatic success and a Baylor University study of its measurable impact on society, Defy Ventures works with returning citizens to help them become tax payers, role models and job creators.</p>

  <p>After starting and succeeding in New York, Defy Ventures is expanding. Oakland’s first-year course is about to launch. A final admissions meeting will be held at the Washington Hotel in downtown Oakland on Sept. 24 at 6 p.m. For those looking to rebuild their lives and their communities, this is a must-see opportunity.</p>

  <p>To learn more about Defy Ventures, we interviewed Dean of Admissions Jose Vasquez, who has flown back and forth from Oakland to New York in the effort to recruit.</p>

  <p>A former heroin dealer turned entrepreneur, Vasquez is both a graduate of Defy Ventures and a budding leader.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Criminal U: Defy Ventures is making headlines across the country for training re-entering citizens. Tell us about the program.</strong>
Jose: Defy recognizes that many former drug dealers and gang leaders can become successful, legal entrepreneurs. We “transform the hustle” of our formerly incarcerated Entrepreneurs-in-Training (EITs) by offering intensive leadership development, Shark Tank-style business plan competitions, executive mentoring, financial investment, and startup incubation. We offer our EITs a legitimate chance to succeed and equip them to become profitable entrepreneurs, stellar employees, engaged parents, and committed role models and leaders in their communities. We intentionally build life-giving, authentic community between EITs and our executive volunteers as they bond in their humanity.</p>

<p>Defy now serves EITs all over the U.S.; <a href="http://defyventures.org/take-action/become-a-student/">click here</a> to enroll in our Introductory Training! Defy enlists business volunteers globally (who provide in-person and online mentoring).</p>

<p>__CU: How did you get involved? __
JV: I got involved with Defy Ventures in 2012 after I completed a two- and a-half-year prison sentence for heroin distribution. I enrolled in Defy Ventures first training here in NYC. I was able to start my own business, make my family proud and now I am part of the Defy staff as Dean of Admissions.</p>

<p>__CU: As the Dean of Admissions, you work with many people getting out and many leaders of the business community. That is pretty rare, right? __
JV: Correct. The great thing able these two worlds are the similarities that they share. Business is business. Regardless of what you are selling — oranges, stocks or drugs — they have the same components, so when we bring our executives to meet our entrepreneurs, connections are made instantly. Our goal is to transform the lives (and hustle) of business leaders and people with criminal histories through their collaboration along the entrepreneurial journey.</p>

<p><strong>CU: Tell us about your success in NYC?</strong>
JV: Here are just a few of our success in NYC:
• In two years, Defy grads legally incorporated 71 businesses and received $140,000 in start-up grants. Nearly all generated revenue within 90 days; the businesses generated 35 new employment opportunities for Defy grads and others.
• 87.5% of grads gained employment and reported an average increase of 122% in annual income within 7 months.
• We engaged 2,000+ executives who have contributed 11,000+ hours of volunteer service, including providing grads with pro bono startup services (legal, marketing, accounting, etc.)
• Our recidivism rate is less than 5%</p>

<p>__CU: How come you are now traveling across country in Oakland? __
JV: Building upon our great success in New York City, Defy Ventures is now expanding nationally, with the Bay Area as our first stop! Defy will now be serving the entire Bay Area: Oakland, San Jose, San Francisco, and surrounding cities. We’ve already recruited some of the Bay Area’s top investors who are ready to see your ideas!</p>

<p>__CU: If someone from the Bay Area wants to get involved, tell them how to do it? __
JV: A few ways. They can contact us directly through our website defyventures.org or they can attend one of our Admissions Meeting coming up in the Bay Area on Sept. 23rd in San Jose and 24th in Oakland. For more information on these two events, email recruiting@defyventures.org</p>

<p><strong>CU: As well as the admissions director you are also an entrepreneur yourself. Tell a little about your entrepreneurial efforts.</strong>
JV: I’ve always had that entrepreneurial spirit through out my life. I started legal and illegal businesses, and I can truly say that what I have learned in the streets has helped me achieve things in my professional life that are incredible. The hard times I survived are what push me everyday. This is why I am not ashamed of my past.</p>

<p>__CU: Preach! Is there anything vitally important I forgot to ask you about! __
JV: No, great questions. I wanted to leave you with a few facts:
•	Roughly 100,000 juveniles leave correctional facilities, State prison, or Federal prison each year. These juveniles have a recidivism rate of 55 to 75%.
•	70% of children with an incarcerated parent will follow in their parents’ footsteps.
•	African-Americans are nearly six times more likely to be incarcerated than whites; Latinos are nearly twice as likely to be incarcerated than whites.
•	In some states, black men have been admitted to prison on drug charges at rates 20 to 50 times greater than those of white men. And in major cities wracked by the drug war, as many as 80% of young African-American men now have criminal records and are thus subject to legalized discrimination for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for helping spread the word in the Bay Area!</p>

<p>__CU: And thanks for the work you do. __</p>
