                <p class="big"><p>“I wonder what has happened to the anti-death penalty movement,” death row inmate <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/capital-punishment/justice-reggie-clemons-not-another-troy-davis">Reggie Clemons</a> told me other day.</p>

<p>It’s a question that has continued to echo through my thoughts ever since.</p>

<p>At a time when the entire criminal justice system and the glaring need for sweeping reform has emerged as a political objective for conservatives and progressives alike, it would seem the death penalty would be prominent in the public spotlight.</p>

<p>At a time when botched executions in 2014 have showed the barbaric, secretive, racist and perhaps even illegal policies that shape our country’s policies, it would seem the abolitionist effort would be more prominent than ever.</p>

<p>At a time when Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley just commuted the last four death row inmates in the state, it would seem that the push to greatly heighten scrutiny and perhaps abolish the inhumane punishment would have significant backing across the country.</p>

<p>But things aren’t what they seem.</p>

<p>In truth, America continues to execute its citizens every month and efforts to speed up executions continue with the enthusiastic backing of the voting populace. In truth, despite botched drugs, secretive practices lacking oversight, glaring suffering of those being executed right before our eyes, the push to heighten executions continues with little energy to stop it.</p>

<p>Why? Because an overwhelming majority of this country’s executions take place in a mere handful of states who by default drive the country’s policy on executions while an overwhelming majority of states and citizens back away from executions because of the obvious problems of inhumanity and institutional racism, not to mention the likely execution of innocent people, which is the greatest crime of all.</p>

<p>Let’s deal with the most inflammatory first: We almost assuredly execute innocent people. The bedrock principle in American jurisprudence of the past 100 years is that an inmate sentenced to death has to exhaust all legal remedies to absolutely guarantee that his guilt is assured and that his crime is particularly heinous. We set a high standard of death sentences, at least in theory.</p>

<p>But if 2014 proved anything its that a wave of people have been locked up for decades for crimes they didn’t commit. In New York alone we have seen good men who never committed a crime locked up, like our own Antonio Yarbough who spent 21 years in a super max facility for the murder of his mother and sister only to be exonerated in 2014. The city has dozens of such cases under review. As Tony said upon his release, “if the state of New York had a death penalty, I’d have been executed by now.”</p>

<p>We’ve highlighted just a few of the exonerations that have occurred because of terribly racist police tactics that were common place through the past thirty year history of the epidemic of incarceration in this country. We know beyond a doubt that many, many citizens are behind bars for crimes they didn’t commit.</p>

<p>If Reggie Clemons is to be believed, he represents one glaring example. Just five days away from being executed at one point, it took Clemons nearly a two decades to earn a judges ruling that his confession was coerced, that Clemons was beaten, that DNA evidence at the scene doesn’t match his and that the police work the night he was arrested in the infamous Chain of Rocks murders was “shoddy.” Yet Clemons remains on death row in Missouri, a zealous execution state that once tried to execute two men in one night but so botched and tortured the first man it had to call of the second. Clemons is still awaiting a retrial that seems vitally necessary in light of the recent legal findings. He remains on death row. Missouri after a brief respite is back in the killing game with executions scheduled this month.</p>

<p>“It has cast a chill on this prison and everyone inside it,” Clemons told me.</p>

<p>Is Clemons innocent? I couldn’t possibly know. But there is no doubt his legal options won’t be exhausted until a new trial is granted and even that hangs in limbo. We also know Clemons’ co-defendants have already been executed.</p>

<p>We can rest assured we execute innocent people, which alone should be enough to spark the anti-death penalty movement into the center of the public stage.</p>

<p>If that simple principle isn’t enough to spark outrage and ignite the anti-death penalty movement, the legal oddity of a mere handful of states setting the policy largely because of the political support in those states for executions demands review. Of all the problems with separate but unequal in our country, perhaps this is most glaring. The federal court system has a moral obligation to ensure that a person in Texas, Missouri, Florida, Oklahoma, Ohio has the same basic rights as a person in places like Oregon and Maryland.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/number-executions-state-and-region-1976">Only ten states</a> have executed more than two people in the last five years and one of those, Mississippi, hasn’t executed anyone in the last two years. Yet nearly 100 people have been executed in those states with far too little accountability.</p>

<p>The death penalty is too extreme and too important to the foundation of our justices system to allow such a separate but unequal process to continue. But in light of such obvious disparity, Reggie Clemons’ question continues to echo through the hall of our moral compass: Where is the anti-death penalty now?</p>
