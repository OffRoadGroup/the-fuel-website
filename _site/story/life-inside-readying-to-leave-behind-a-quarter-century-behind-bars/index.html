                <p class="big"><p>John Michael Hamilton is one of the important characters you’ll meet in my forthcoming memoir. He is a complex man, with a unique story who I had the pleasure of meeting inside Criminal U. He first sought me out for friendship at a time I needed it.</p>

<p>Four months into my sentence, a guard approached me at my job, folding laundry.</p>

<p>“You’re Bolsinger?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Roll up.”</p>

<p>A jolt of panic hit my chest. My shoulders jerked visibly.</p>

<p>“Where am I going?” I asked. I had already learned what virtually every inmate instinctively knows: Change is rarely good. Almost never good. Never easy. Never, never easy.</p>

<p>“The Pen,” he said, confirming my worst fears.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>He shrugged and walked away.</p>

<p>Within hours I was “the new guy” in the fishbowl, a large glass room on the main floor of Oregon State Penitentiary, the state’s only maximum-security prison, home to its death row. I had been charged for a second time, financial charges my attorney had once brushed away as inconsequential. At the time he said, “They won’t amount to five days in jail.”</p>

<p>Now the prosecutor was seeking 15 years, requiring my transfer to The Pen.</p>

<p>At first I made my transition well. But soon, as inevitably happens with bored inmates locked in an endless cycle of hopeless, I became a target.</p>

<p>I learned to walk quickly, eat carefully, trust no one and never relax. I clung to my sanity with calls home to Lori and the kids, whose unflinching love became the inspiration for my survival. I stared out the bars of my cell and wondered if this would become my “normal” for years to come.</p>

<p>I set up a meeting with John, a bank robber wrapping up a 15-year set who had reached out to me in friendship. He had been looking into the smear campaign going on about me behind my back. We met out on the yard on a rainy winter afternoon.</p>

<p>“You’re smarter than all these guys,” he told me. “You know all this shit. The politics—90 percent con and hustle. If they think you’re soft, they’ll never let up. They want to get paid more than they care about hurting you. Use your brains. Make it hard for them. They’ll move on to someone else.”</p>

<p>I thanked John. I stuffed my hands into my pockets and pulled my wet beanie down on my head. I set my resolve to survive well. I dove into prison politics. I turned the tide against me. I survived. As John predicted, they moved on to easier prey.</p>

<p>I learned later that John had sat back and watched. I needed to pass a few tests about life inside. He needed to see how I’d respond. I earned his respect. Soon without ever knowing it a group of long-time inmates put out the word only because John asked them to. He had that sway and it benefited me even when I didn’t know it.</p>

<p>John helped me adapt to the state pen when I was still a raw, underclassmen – a potential target for the veterans not too dissimilar from military school hazing if you throw in the real potential for severe physical abuse and the potential for endless extortion. I would never be exposed or vulnerable again. With John’s help, I learned my lessons well.</p>

<p>Three years later when I was approaching the end of my education at Criminal U, I looked across the yard at the minimum security camp where I was finishing out my set. I had reached that point that I had seen in others like John years before. I didn’t want to meet new inmates. I watched to see who would prove themselves before I wasted my time. As I looked across the yard, I saw a worn out guy looking like all sorts of hell walking and talking with another inmate in the endless circles around the yard like a kennel dog.</p>

<p>He noticed me first.</p>

<p>John was back and he looked the worse for wear for a man who had been given his freedom. Neither of us knew, but the roles were now reversed. I had status on this yard. John was new and had lost his physical luster. Nobody knew his reputation, a hard-earned one from the country’s most notorious prisons like Levenworth and Bloody Baumont. In more than two decades inside he had never been in a minimum prison. It was new and unfamiliar and he struggled to adapt. I returned the lesson he gave me.</p>

<p>“You’re smarter than these guys,” I told him.</p>

<p>Like me at OSP, John adapted. Soon he had his legs beneath him again.</p>

<p>We grew close. He taught me to play the guitar better. I worked with him on his writing. We both worked in the school helping inmates earn their GEDs. But the closer I got to release, the more John concerned me. The tension between us grew. Issues rose mainly as we both looked to life outside. Would we try to connect on the outs as we said? Most inmates talk a good game, walk out the gates, and never look back to the same men they once called “brothers.” But John and I tried to be real, and the reality caused concern. For the first time I had my doubts about him. Would he truly reform and break a life of incarceration?</p>

<p>Nevertheless as I walked out of the prison to freedom at 12:10 a.m. and greeted my family in the dark parking lot, a single beam from a flashlight in an upper window danced happily. I knew it was John, shooting fireworks into my freedom night sky.</p>

<p>After a few weeks I started writing the guys in our little group. I saved John’s for last, which I knew would piss him off. Unlike the others, which were upbeat and friendly, I took my friend John to task.</p>

<p>“Am I just a mark to you,” I asked? I called him out on all types of behaviors I had seen those last weeks that suggested John was still running his game, a game that would bring him back to prison again.</p>

<p>I heard from my other friends John had taken my letter badly. Weeks went by. Finally his angry response came. He was hurt. He showed little understanding of what I was talking about. It made me think a lot about my letter and why I had written it.</p>

<p>I began to understand I had to see what he’d do with his remaining nine months in prison. Would this truly be “it” for him? Or would it be the beginning of his end. Even though he was not yet 50, he’d spent half his life behind bars. If he came back again, he’d become those guys we’d seen – lifers with vacations, we’d call them. Guys who’d done way too much time and every time they got released would “vacation” by running amok until the law rounded them up. Sooner or later they’d get a long set and that would be that. With John’s past, he would get nailed to the cross if he ever got caught doing serious crime again.</p>

<p>Just as John had sat back at OSP and watched me learn what I was made of, I guess I needed to sit back and learn the same about him.</p>

<p>Well, months have passed and John is preparing to leave. For the first time in nearly a quarter century of incarceration he went to treatment. He has worked every day, 15 hours a day in a six-month treatment program – the same one I went through. He’d call every now and again and I could hear the change. I could sense the skin shedding from him, the layers of criminal thinking that had imprisoned him more than bars and barbed wire ever had, falling away.</p>

<p>“Since the first day I went to prison, I’ve never been comfortable in my own skin,” the most experienced inmate I’ve ever met told me. “I am becoming comfortable in my own skin now.”</p>

<p>Yesterday we made plans for me to pick him up when he gets out. I’ll be the one shooting fireworks into the sky and he’ll be the one walking into freedom, confident at last, that his last day ever spent in Criminal U is behind him.</p>
