                <p class="big"><p>Spend time more wisely then dollars. And be generous with both.</p>

<p>Money and time. These are the obsessions. One thousand years from now when technology has made us all immortal, they may not care any more about time, but I’m guessing money will still twist even our robot-selves into knots. We view the world through shades of green.</p>

<p>If one thing causes most of us to obsess above all else, it is money. I have seen otherwise healthy people turn into Frankenstein over it. We’d seemingly eat our young to have more of it.</p>

<p>It’s a trap. Yeah, yeah, we say. We know all about the trap and the down side and the scads of stories of those whose lives became a living hell over the worship of money. Then we go right on and stick our hands into the trap.</p>

<p>Consider this one of those flashing warning signs “Danger ahead.” It is no coincidence Jesus said it is harder for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter heaven. Remind wealthy American Christians about this and uniformly they slip into Biblical gymnastics about metaphor and illustration and all sorts of other explanations of why Jesus didn’t really mean what he said. Press them further and like a cracking witness on the stand, they’ll shout out, “Yes but it is not impossible for the camel! Right? Anything is possible with Jeee-sus!”</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, money is wonderful — one of the good things in life. With it you can eat great foods, drink better wine, live with views, travel, play well and do acts of good will. It would be hypocritical of me to turn legalistic about money when my very point is to avoid such legalism in other relevant topics like love, sex, faith, morals, and lifestyles.</p>

<p>For the record I think Jesus was merely stating the obvious. In our culture we have a bumper-sticker saying that says the same thing: “You can’t take it with you.” We all enter heaven with our green security blankets left behind. Jesus’ statement also cut to the heart of our problems, namely greed. By simply reminding the rich man how dear his money was, how he worshiped it more than anything else, he was pointing to the trap, the false security that this man’s wealth had become.</p>

<p>It’s likely beyond the scope of this book, but the subject of the rich young ruler is idolatry… money is the verb.</p>

<p>The point here is perspective, which brings us to the reason time is coupled here with money in this rule. It’s a question of importance, of priority, of perspective.</p>

<p>You know the old card game “Bullshit?” People try to bluff their hands and when their opponent thinks they’ve caught them in a lie, they yell out “Bullshit.” It’s fun. We’d be better off if we used such basic communication skills in every day life. For example, how often do we hear, “I’d love to but I am so busy. I don’t have time.”</p>

<p>“BULLSHIT!” B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T!”</p>

<p>Call it like you see it. If there is one truism I’m sure of in this world it’s that we generally make the time for what is most important to us. If we work 90-hour weeks, it’s because it’s important to us, either the way it satiates our ambition, or lines our pockets, or inflates our ego, or hides us from folks we don’t want to see, like our spouses, for example. How many young couples, head-over-heels in love, don’t somehow squeeze time for each other? A two-hour phone conversation with a new lover is as easy as a nap on a winter day, so why is it that two years later a ten-minute phone call is filled with awkward silences between the same people?</p>

<p>Time doesn’t lie. Even more than money, y<em>our heart is where you spend time</em>. Money has power and sway and seduces us constantly but it lacks the same sense of True North that time holds in our world. Time is a compass of our inner desires. Not sure what is most important to you?</p>

<p>Look first at your last few bank statements. They’ll tell the tale of your inner tape. Why do I not flinch each month when such a huge chunk of my money is used to pay for my home? Because I’m in love with my city. High-rent prices be damned.</p>

<p>But if you really want to know what is important to you look at your time check book register. Where your time went, well that really tells the tale of the tape. Together, you have a pretty good picture of who you are and how you want to leave your mark on this world.</p>

<p>The challenge is to spend both time and money wisely as a reflection of your goals, morals and relationships.</p>

<p>When push comes to shove, pay even more attention to how you spend your time. You can always make more money. Time is like sand in an hourglass, slipping away. You have only what destiny has afforded you. If that third hour of television is that important to you, so be it. Just don’t bullshit yourself.</p>

<p>The challenge of life is to be generous whether its time or money or both. Cultivate a true generous spirit and I suspect you’ll live a more abundant life. I think the reason the book Tuesdays with Morrie  was such a tremendous best-seller was due to how it tapped into a hidden wellspring within each of us that flows with our better selves. Morrie’s generous spirit permeates the book and infuses into the heart of the author. Yet it only happened — and thereby passed along to millions -– because of the author’s investment of time. There is no hidden passage around time. Invest it in creative energy of life and it will return dividends of relationship, wisdom, contentment and joy. Fail to do so and those things will return bankrupt.</p>

<p>“Quality time” is an idol of American greed. Quality time comes from time spent, from the journey, from footprints left behind side by side, not from text messages and tweets.</p>

<p>A generous spirit toward time and money is a surefire way to avoid the trap and its power to enslave you. I think it truly is the freedom trail of life. I hope so anyway.</p>
