                <p class="big"><p>Pope Francis used his tremendous popularity to advocate for a largely unpopular position this week: He called for the abolition of both the death penalty and life sentences, according to the Catholic News Service.</p>

<p>With a gnarled finger pointed directly at the United States, the Pope “denounced what he called a ‘penal populism’ that promises to solve society’s problems by punishing crime instead of pursuing social justice.”</p>

<p>All those American politicians tripping over themselves to get to the head of the line touting criminal justice reform after decades of indifference and epidemic incarceration, suddenly pulled one of those Fred Flinstone and Barney Rubble breaking maneuvers with feet in the dirt and screech marks in the prehistoric sand.</p>

<p>Say What? they probably said. We want criminal justice reform but no death penalty? No life sentences? Let’s not get crazy.</p>

<p>Politicians want criminal justice reform because its now fashionable. But they want to talk it without incurring the costs of enacting substantial reform. They have even less interest in assessing their role in the Pope’s perfectly parsed ‘penal populism.’ (Say that five times fast!)</p>

<p>Politicians knew the billion-dollar boondoggle that is the American prison system was unsustainable, inefficient and ineffective. When 95 percent of all those incarcerated return to society where the odds are so stacked against them that a super-majority will re-offend at great cost to society, something is wrong with the “lock ’em up and throw away the key” mentality.</p>

<p>When prisons and jails outnumber colleges and when it costs more to incarcerate an adult than educate a child, something’s amiss.</p>

<p>But none of this is new. What’s new is polling numbers showed people were finally started to question the whole epidemic numbers of incarceration. What’s new is billionaire backers like the Koch Brothers on the right and George Soros on the left starting offering millions to politicians with a plan.</p>

<p>And maybe, just maybe, what’s new is politicians started looking around and noticing that the incarceration system they unleashed was circling back around toward them. Don’t think for a minute they didn’t notice the sentences of Rod Blagojevich, Jesse Jackson Jr. and Ray Nagin and start rethinking the whole thing. Those were just the high-profile criminal charges. Check out just how rampant criminal charges against politicians really is by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_state_and_local_politicians_convicted_of_crimes">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>In 2012 a New York Times columnist wrote that politicians were aware of the absolute dysfunction of our criminal justice system, but “lacked the political will” to do anything about it. By 2016 criminal justice reform will likely be the only bipartisan issue on both presidential planks regardless of who becomes the eventual nominees.</p>

<p>That’s a sudden shift.</p>

<p>The fact is Republicans golden ticket since the Willie Horton campaign against Michael Dukakis in 1988 was “tough on crime.” Democrats, reeling from the attack became even tougher on crime. As a new book, <em>The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America</em>, <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/01/15/blame-liberals">makes the case</a> liberals are also to blame for epidemic incarceration.</p>

<p>Ironically, something good has come amid all this huffing and puffing by the big bad political wolves. Because politicos are talking about it, folks are interested in reading about it and the legitimate players on the reform scene who have been long ignored are getting the message of its value out to a formerly disinterested public.</p>

<p>Case in point, <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/03/20/too-old-to-commit-crime?ref=hp-3-111">a new story</a> by The Marshall Project that shows the cost of life sentences far outweigh their value in protecting against future crime.</p>

<p>The story notes significant congressional testimony on an idea that likely seems outlandish now, but will soon gain traction on its merit alone.</p>

<p>The idea of a 21-year sentence for mass murder and terrorism may seem radically lenient in the United States, where life without parole is often presented as a humane alternative to the death penalty. Yet in testimony last week to a congressional task force on reforming the federal prison system, Marc Mauer, the director of the <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/template/index.cfm">Sentencing Project</a>, an advocacy group, suggested exactly that approach. He made the case for a 20-year cap on federal prison terms with an option for parole boards or judges to add more time if necessary to protect the public.</p>

<p>Such a policy would “control costs” in a system that is now 40 percent over capacity, Mauer told the task force, and would “bring the United States more in line with other industrialized nations.”</p>

<p>Of course, just a couple of years ago a “congressional task force on reforming the federal prison system” simply wouldn’t have existed. Politicians would have opted for root canal without Novocaine before getting their name associated with such a committee.</p>

<p>This describes the new political will for criminal justice reform. Long silenced and ignored, facts long known are finally getting their day in the public forum. This is an essential first step toward change. It’s an essential step to begin considering whether death penalties and life sentences without the possibility of parole do more harm than good. It’s a step to asking the much needed question: what best serves a just society?</p>

<p>The Pope using his bully pulpit doesn’t hurt either.</p>
