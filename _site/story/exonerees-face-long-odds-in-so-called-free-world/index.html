                <p class="big"><p>I read a story by a writer I’ve met via email a couple of times. In a day and age with so much to read out over so many different ways to experience it, it is becoming increasingly rare for me to sit a read an entire long-form journalistic piece.</p>

<p>This shames me a bit, because writing long-form journalism is my favorite part of my job when I get the opportunity. I also think it’s where the future of journalism is headed, directly opposed to the tidbits, bullet points, click-happy, Internet-driven fodder that churns relentless over the wireless airwaves of today.</p>

<p>So when I find a compelling story that grabs me, draws me in and keeps me reading for a good 20 or 30 minutes or even more, it is special.
<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/exonerated-and-out-of-prison-and-thats-when-the-trouble-star#.bfkLk1ykM">This story</a>, by Buzzfeed’s Albert Samaha is special. Very special. Samaha captures the crux of an emerging national problem: more than hundreds people a year are leaving prison, exonerated for their crimes after doing lengthy, unjust sentences despite their innocence. These exonerees face terribly long odds in their transition to what Clarence Harrison says in Samaha’s piece, “the so-called free world.”</p>

<p>The denial of how many innocent people are in prison for years and years remains one of the most difficult hurdles for society to overcome. Yet it’s essential if we are to craft the significant reforms this broken billion-dollar boondoggle we call our prison system needs.</p>

<p>Just one example: A few years back I was in a prison rehab program. Six months, 15 hours a day. Six days a week. Intensive. Tough. If you fail you lose your early release privileges, and you can fail for most any reason. During that time I heard a counselor say that in six years working in the program with hundreds coming through each year he had never known a single innocent inmate. He said this with a straight face and utter believability despite the simple fact that to express your innocence in such a program is to fail for refusing to take responsibility for your crime.</p>

<p>This is the disconnect that must be addressed, because we know for a fact that hundreds of people are convicted of life sentences and death sentences for crimes they didn’t commit. Those are just the one lengthy enough to fight the decades-long appeals battle for freedom.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people, every single year are being found innocent and dumped back into society’s so-called free world. Consider that a moment.</p>

<p>Our own Antonio Yarbough was one of those, more celebrated than others because he was among the first of what will likely be dozens to be exonerated in Brooklyn, New York. Dozens… from one borough of one city. One day, Yarbough was in the only home he’d known as an adult– the Supermax prison at Attica– and then 48 hours later he was free and speaking to Piers Morgan on CNN. He was also couch surfing and virtually penniless. Life in the so-called free world.</p>

<p>Yet somehow, Tony has done well. He is unusual in that regard. Most don’t, according to Samaha’s article. Most suffer the fate of Harrison who, “was financially illiterate” at the age of 50 when he returned to the so-called free world. Harrison was awarded a million dollar settlement. He lost it all. But how it he lost it, and how he continues to advocate for criminal justice reform is what makes this story so compelling.</p>

<p>The single best part of the job of a writer is this: a story well told. This may be one of the best I’ve read in recent years to accomplish just that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before the state of Georgia gave him a million dollars and before he lost it all, Clarence Harrison was convicted of rape and robbery and sentenced to life in prison in 1987. Years passed. His wife divorced him. He became estranged from his two young daughters. His mother died. He got cancer and had a kidney removed. He lost hope. He stopped communicating with everybody on the outside. He resigned himself to spending the rest of his life behind bars and being buried in the prison cemetery, which inmates called Pissant Hill.</p>

  <p>Then in 2004, 18 years after he was arrested, a DNA test proved that he was innocent.</p>
